Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999  and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.
Although  as you will have seen  the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise  still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days  during this part-session.
In the meantime  I should like to observe a minute' s silence  as a number of Members have requested  on behalf of all the victims concerned  particularly those of the terrible storms  in the various countries of the European Union.
Please rise  then  for this minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Madam President  on a point of order.
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam  who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.
Would it be appropriate for you  Madam President  to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?
Yes  Mr Evans  I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.
If the House agrees  I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.
Madam President  on a point of order.
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report  not a legislative proposal  and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.
That is precisely the time when you may  if you wish  raise this question  i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.
Madam President  coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament  a date has been set  unfortunately for next Thursday  in Texas in America  for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.
At the request of a French Member  Mr Zimeray  a petition has already been presented  which many people signed  including myself.
However  I would ask you  in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community  to make representations  using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent  to the President and to the Governor of Texas  Mr Bush  who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.
Thank you  Mr Segni  I shall do so gladly.
Indeed  it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.
Madam President  I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia  too  access to environmental information is a constitutional right.
Now  however  he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.
We know  and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed  including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year  that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea  and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position  as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted  clear as far as Russia is concerned.
Yes  Mrs Schroedter  I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.
Madam President  I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that  during this first part-session of the new year  the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.
But  Madam President  my personal request has not been met.
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one  there is still no Dutch channel  which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel  I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.
It will  I hope  be examined in a positive light.
Madam President  can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?
Why has there been no fire drill  either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?
Why are there no fire instructions?
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.
Mrs Lynne  you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors  and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.
Madam President  Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President  Mrs de Palacio  which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.
I would ask that they reconsider  since this is not the case.
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention  on another occasion  and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.
Mr Berenguer Fuster  we shall check all this.
I admit that  at present  the matter seems to be somewhat confused.
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.
Madam President  I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia  considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.
So Parliament should send a message  since that is the wish of the vast majority.
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.
As people have said  the situation there is extremely volatile.
There is  in fact  a risk of a military coup in the future.
We do not know what is happening.
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?
In any event  this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.
Agenda
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.
Relating to Wednesday:
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.
I would like Mr Barón Crespo  who made the request  to speak to propose it. That is  if he so wishes  of course.
Then we shall follow the usual procedure  hearing one speaker in favour and one against.
Madam President  the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi  who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and  therefore  basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.
I would also like to point out  Madam President  that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature  in July  and then  in September  it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.
To this end  I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September  which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents  that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme  in which case it should clarify it.
According to its President  it is in a position to do so.
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio  I believe that  before voting  it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme  as agreed. Alternatively  Parliament is not ready to examine this programme  as some appear to be suggesting.
In my opinion  this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament  as well as introducing an original thesis  an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware  in writing  of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier  as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February  so we could forego the debate  since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen  debate and reflect  there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that  if the Commission is ready to do so  we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.
Therefore  the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists  and which you have mentioned  is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday  including its proposed administrative reform  because  otherwise  we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text  on the one hand  the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and  on the other hand  there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.
Therefore  Madam President  I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Madam President  I really am quite astonished at Mr Barón Crespo' s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday's agenda.
Mr Barón Crespo  you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.
I am not criticising this; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.
Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion.
In the Conference of Presidents  we had an in-depth discussion.
Your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now.
We then put it to a vote.
As you know  each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members.
There was a vote on this matter.
As I recall  the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions.
This means that all the Groups with the exception of the non-attached Members - but  of course  they are not a Group - were in agreement; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here.
All of the others were of a different opinion.
That was the decision.
I should now like to comment on the issue itself.
We have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and  after a difficult procedure  as everyone knows  the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission.
We believe  however  that the Commission's strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework  not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament  but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-year period.
There is no such document!
The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February.
We have said  very well  if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February.
We have agreed to this.
After all  we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission; if at all possible  we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path.
However  we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission.
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our Groups.
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content.
That is why we would recommend - and it is my impression that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission's long-term programme up to the year 2005 in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that  at the same time  in February we also hold the debate on the Commission's legislative programme for the year 2000.
The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.
That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting  I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?
Madam President  I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda  because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.
I do not know whether this information is correct  but the PPE-DE Group would  in any case  be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.
Thank you  Mr Poettering.
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.
Madam President  I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents  and now he is doing just the same.
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous  with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups.
As my fellow chairmen will recall  I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax  but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.
It is not a lot to ask.
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out  once and for all  the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion  particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.
(Parliament rejected the request  with 164 votes for  166 votes against and 7 abstentions)
Madam President  I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.
Thank you very much.
Madam President  has my vote been counted?
I was unable to vote electronically  since I do not have a card.
My vote was "in favour" .
Indeed  if we add the two Members who have declared themselves  then the result of the vote would be ....
Madam President  the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.
There is no room for amendments.
Madam President  in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.
That did not happen.
I would appreciate it if  on the close of this item of business  I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.
This is an important matter.
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.
Madam President  I do not wish to reopen the debate  but I had also asked for the floor  to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.
You did not call me either.
I regret this  but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.
I am terribly sorry  Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox.
I did not see you asking to speak.
Even so  I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow  then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.
This seems to me to be a workable solution.
Of course  the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.
Mr Cox  Mr Hänsch  would this be acceptable to you?
Madam President  if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not  and cannot  object to that.
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote  I accept that but with reservations.
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes  as we always do  of course.
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted  then we may correct them  if necessary.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch  on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism  on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road  rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).
Commissioner  Madam President  ladies and gentlemen  I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road  rail or inland waterway.
Firstly  we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC  which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training  instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.
Secondly  by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.
Thirdly  this directive  as it currently stands in the common position  guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.
Our amendments from the first reading have  I believe  been taken into account very satisfactorily.
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance  or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included  for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport  which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive  is something which I would urge you to support.
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force  we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.
I would urge you to endorse this.
Madam President  we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads  but also on our railways and waterways  not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.
As an Austrian  I still have a vivid memory  as  I believe  we all do  of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel  where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.
The renovation project  which lasted for months  cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.
In fact  all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available  so that the right action is taken in good time.
All the same  we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that  where transport safety in Europe is concerned  there is still much more to be done.
In this context  I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible  who is with us here today  to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future  so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.
Madam President  first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has  at its heart  the issue of transport safety.
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road  rail and inland waterway.
I congratulate him on his excellent report.
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London  the terrible rail crash in Norway  the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.
Madam President  I would like to make a few comments.
I would like  first of all  to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and  secondly  the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also  in fact  with minimum requirements.
This is a pity  in a sense.
Needless to say  safety on roads  railways and inland waterways is of key importance and  given the international nature of these types of transport  training for safety advisors should also be harmonised  therefore  as well as the requirements of the new ADR  for example  which is under way.
This is important  but so is enforcement and there are  of course  a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years  for example in Belgium  the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here  with all the obvious risks that this entails.
Furthermore  it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium  Finland  but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.
In short  the issue is an important one.
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned  in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present  especially with smaller companies  as these cannot afford safety advisors.
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo  which causes problems.
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.
I would like to mention one final point.
With regard to enforcement  proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001  that is to say in eighteen months' time.
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.
This is not in itself anything dreadful  but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road  rail and inland waterways and incorporate these  as part of the acquis communautaire  as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.
Madam President  the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks  known and unknown  for employees and the social environment.
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive  95/35/EC  seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations  although I would have preferred it if uniform  set standards and modules had been established  so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.
This  however  does not seem feasible.
Finally  the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can  therefore  give it my wholehearted support.
Mr President  Commissioner  I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which  though technical  are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.
I should like to make just a few comments.
Firstly  I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety  be it on the roads  on the waterways or at sea.
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998  even though Parliament responded relatively quickly  this time lag is a little too long.
This is not just the fault of the Commission  but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.
In principle  I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.
However  when it comes to safety  I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden  for example  is in principle no different from safety in Germany  Italy or Austria.
I can live with these minimum standards  but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.
My third point has also been mentioned already.
As you know  like Mr Rack  I come from a transit country  where this issue plays a particularly important role.
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum  in all countries  whether they are transit countries or not.
Mr President  I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur  Mr Koch  on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road  rail or inland waterway.
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy  and in particular the transport group  is magnificent.
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and  at second reading  we can accept the amendment on the proposed date  which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission  bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.
Very briefly  I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly  this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.
In this regard  I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels  which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to  which  in the case of Austria  is doubtless a very sensitive issue  and great effort should be made to improve their safety.
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently  the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which  in principle  do not present risks  led to a genuine disaster.
Therefore  we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.
Finally  I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport  in light of the Erika disaster  and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster  we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety  but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances  which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur  Mr Koch.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch  on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism  on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].
Mr President  Commissioner  ladies and gentlemen  the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road  which entered into force on 1 January 1997  contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time  the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN  that is the European Committee for Standardisation.
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.
In particular  annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.
In this respect  I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.
Should the European Union fail to take action  then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period  until the CEN completes its work  which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines  deletes provisions which are no longer applicable  and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations  in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own.
In so doing  it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.
The proposal to be discussed today  to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road  dates from May 1999  however  and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.
In addition  the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements  in particular for vacuum tanks  if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC.
This is in the special interest of northern European regions.
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety  but I would ask you to endorse this report.
Mr President  colleagues  a happy new year and millennium to you all.
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session  so this is quite exciting for me  a little like first love  although that did last longer than two minutes.
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.
It is good that this directive should be established now  as  otherwise  Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time  a period of transition  which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.
The Commission' s proposal  however  does not take account of all the facts  such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.
Consequently  I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report  which have been adopted by our committee.
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient.
On the shores of the Mediterranean  it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.
There is support for the EU in Lapland also  so let us remember them.
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.
Mr President  with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.
I thought that it was quite superb.
On the subject at hand  I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads  railways  and so on are as safe as possible.
This directive is a contribution to this.
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.
The rapporteur  Mr Koch  to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this  has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN  which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that  in 2001  we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.
Mr President  the report we are discussing here does not  in itself  entail any major changes. Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that  each time we make this type of decision  it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU  both on roads and railways and by sea.
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind. In area after area  we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.
This is extraordinarily positive  and there is cause to thank the rapporteur  Mr Koch  for the work he has put in on this issue.
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running  it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also  as far as possible  apply to every country.
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance  namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament  Mr Ari Vatanen.
In many ways  the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.
By approving this amendment  we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.
It is good that  in establishing the present regulations  we can also be flexible. I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.
Mr President  I would like to thank not only Mr Koch  but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations  and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts  in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union  traffic does not stop at our borders  it goes beyond them.
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?
Mr President  I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report  which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able  in the required time  to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.
A moment ago  Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures  not of 20 degrees below zero  but of 40 degrees below zero.
Of course  we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union  which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.
I would like to say  with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN  that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if  despite the new deadline  we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.
Lastly  Mr President  the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN  the amendment of certain provisions  the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur  Mr Koch  which are contained in the various amendments  specifically four.
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter  on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism  on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].
Mr President  it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament  namely Wales.
A major part of Wales  as you know  has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.
We are looking  therefore  within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.
What is  however  deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been  in a sense  a success of the government.
It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.
We look to it to challenge the UK Government  to ensure that the private sector  which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure  is involved in the planning stage.
Finally  we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.
Mr President  our committee views these issues very differently and  to start  I will speak from the point of view of research.
We see it as a very positive sign that  in her own conclusions  the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.
This will be possible with action on the part of governments  and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.
Another matter we would like to address  specifically from the point of view of industrial policy  is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services  electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet  when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry  but today those areas might have become a burden  and they may well be poor  meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production  as I might call it  and the production of services  because they are the industries of the future.
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this  so on behalf of the Committee on Industry  External Trade  Research and Energy  I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.
Finally  as the committee representing energy  we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more  thus  through a process of coordination  increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.
Mr President  I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague  Mrs Flautre  who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism.
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.
In the past  this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.
In her report  Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking  yet desperately needed.
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted  as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance  which is subject to review after three and a half years  and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.
Mr President  Commissioner  the proposal presented by the Commission  in accordance with its mandate  is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I would like to point out  however  that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas  given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.
This  as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment  which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity  exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.
The consequences do not inspire hope.
It is the young people who are disappearing  who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas  all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.
Furthermore  three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.
For this reason  one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas  outside of the agricultural sector  in sectors such as rural tourism  sport  culture  heritage conservation  the conversion of businesses  new technologies  services  etc. However  even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive  it is still essential  not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns  but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land  in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.
Therefore  we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas  at the dawn of the 21st century  to be competitive and multi-functional  both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium  and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues  which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport  Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.
In conclusion  I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that  for the European Union  maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.
Mr President  Commissioner  I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter  the rapporteur  for her work.
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament  at least in spirit  because at this stage  it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise  and nothing but hot air.
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament  particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.
In our amendments  we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds  the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives  so that their application should be reflected  in the best and most profitable way  by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are  when all is said and done  the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives  we think that those who generate employment  the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment  that is  businesspeople  must participate in this initiative.
Small and medium-sized businesses  above all  need to take part in the distribution of these funds.
If they do not  if businesspeople feel marginalised  if entrepreneurs cannot take part  not only in managing but also in receiving these funds  we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.
Also  in order to attain our objectives  to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment  it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies  to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business  which  by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations  but complementing them  never obstructing or excluding them  will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.
Mr President  it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague  Mr Evans  of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.
Let me also remind him that when his party leader  Mr Hague  was Secretary of State for Wales  he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration  to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development  resulting in inevitable delays and underspends  particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer  either in the Commission or in the civil service.
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate  while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad  indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence  which will be the key to future success.
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good  solid  enabling guideline  can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.
Mr President  Commissioner  I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report.
She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.
We are badly behind now in this matter.
Hopefully  the stands Parliament has taken will help  however  in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.
For the time  the report grew too large when it was being debated. It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy  bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity  the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes. It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned. Projects have to be carried out more efficiently  more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.
While the report was being prepared  it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.
For us new members  it was the first time  and this was a very interesting process.
This report is very good and our Group supports it.
Mr President  Commissioner  as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution  the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group  Elisabeth Schroedter  has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.
Bearing this in mind  this House should  in any event  demand that  before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved  they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament  specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today. This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.
Mr President  we should not forget that the main  strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.
We will have to study several indicators  which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others  and how they are evolving.
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.
This fact means that the European Parliament  the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity  as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.
I do not think  however  that this report has come too late.
We need to consider it together  so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development  which have been drafted before the directives come into force  can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.
We all agree that we should ask that  halfway through these programmes  when the assessment of the directives is made  Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is  at least on the face of it  bureaucratic.
They need to see the political dimension working  to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.
I would like to think that  given his previous experience as a regional President  he will agree to propose indicators  and a strategy  which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.
Mr President  I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas. This latter point is of particular importance.
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries  mainly through the upgrading of roads  water treatment and related transport networks.
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year  which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.
Key EU programmes between 1989  1993  1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date.
This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions  the poorer regions in Europe  are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone  as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods  persons  services and capital exist.
In conclusion  while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund  we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions  financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment  assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.
Mr President  on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time  however  I actually agree with her.
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path  I cannot say. Nevertheless  I would like to commend her on her work.
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex  as we and Mrs McCarthy  as rapporteurs for the general regulation  had asked.
Unfortunately  this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.
Thirdly  we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States  and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development  job creation and  more particularly  on equal opportunities and transport issues.
Personally  I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.
As an islander  however  I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament  and I have raised the issue time and time again.
Commissioner  we shall continue to raise the issue  as Article 158  paragraph 1  of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.
Therefore  the Commission should address the issue once and for all.
The time has come to implement the programmes  and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.
As for us in Parliament  I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.
Mr President  Commissioner  in this minute and a half I should like  first of all  to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.
I know many have already done so  but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides  and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.
I share the regrets she expressed  namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines  since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect  which in my view is a pity.
Consequently  I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003  and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.
In brief  I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006  which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will  of course  have a considerable impact  both in budgetary and geographical terms.
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.
Finally  in this time of natural disasters  I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.
As you know  it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.
Europe should not be completely absent  as the states tend to want.
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response  even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.
I also think we should ensure  or ask Member States to ensure  that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.
Mr President  the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.
As far as French planning experts are concerned  for example  the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.
Well  the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax  which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.
The Commission  however  though bound to issue guidelines  does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.
Mr President  I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.
Over the coming years  faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement  Europe will  more than ever before  require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.
To this end  Europe as a whole  and each Member State individually  will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities  including the Structural Funds.
For this to be possible  what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions  but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.
For example  in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds  mainly because of excessive bureaucracy  insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.
There are  therefore  two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention.
Firstly  we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making  precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly  a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent  since  they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated  to the point of hindering access to the Funds.
This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses  in particular  tend to complain.
I will conclude  Mr President  by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and  especially  methods of combating unemployment among women and young people  is cause for serious concern.
Mr President  like my colleague Mr Evans  it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue  especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom  the West Midlands  which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how  if we are not very careful  we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.
The report itself is well-intentioned but  as so often when we deal with these issues  lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text  not to take anything away from the proposal  but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.
I would like to explain our thinking here.
Firstly  we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Past experience dictates that  as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer  we should  and indeed must  demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money  hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.
Next  we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer  but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.
Finally  we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects  which are hard to monitor  towards capital schemes where  in the majority of cases  the benefits are there for all to see.
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today  I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about  namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living  not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".
I urge the House to support these changes.
Mr President  Commissioner  I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report  which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are  without doubt  essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.
Despite the steps taken thus far  these levels are still very high  and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective  they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development  unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.
In closing  I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium  for which we all hope for the best.
Mr President  Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations  and I would like to congratulate her on that.
However  I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.
Quite briefly  structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way  rather it aggravates it.
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy  which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers  particularly in the South.
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report  we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.
Little consideration  if any at all  has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure  transport  communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.
Unfortunately  the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.
Mr President  I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.
The first is the fundamental  central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.
Secondly  I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.
In future  we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as  in my country  the islands of the Azores and Madeira.
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions  which has been long awaited by Parliament?
Mr President  first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur  not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.
Mr President  Commissioner  the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.
However  contrary to their claim to provide guidance  the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.
Nonetheless  their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration  and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive  small and medium-sized enterprises  on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing  and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10  to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.
I should be very grateful  Mrs Schroedter  if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.
Mr President  Commissioner  in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs  we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.
Unfortunately  the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion  despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how  in fact  these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.
They are growing  but only in terms of GDP.
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.
Commissioner  please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority  because this is our citizens' greatest problem.
Please take account  in strategic terms  in the revision and in the allocation of reserves  of employment needs  because this  fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.
Mr President  it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation  particularly for women and young people  and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas  employment in rural areas  aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which  of course  comprise half of the islands of the Union  as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.
Mr President  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments  occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.
Everyone understands  Mrs Schroedter  ladies and gentlemen  the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays  since we are discussing this report right now  as the representative for the Commission  I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.
Mrs Schroedter  you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters  European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires  and is the justification for  a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.
So  ladies and gentlemen  I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you  Mrs Schroedter  and the various Members of this House  have made.
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines  Mr Hatzidakis  Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1  2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.
This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities  based on past experience in implementing the programmes  as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use  to the optimum and efficient use  as some of you have wished  of Community involvement  including  Mr Bradbourn  using  if necessary  the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.
When I speak of optimum utilisation  I am referring both to the national and regional levels. And so  Mr Seppänen  I shall also mention at this point  speaking of the national level  the link with the Cohesion Fund.
This is the purpose of these guidelines.
Regarding their content  as you know  ladies and gentlemen of this House  they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but  at the same time  very passionately  as I understood her presentation just now.
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create  in all sectors  but especially in the private sector  as Mr Berend said  the maximum number of serious  worthwhile and permanent jobs  the competitiveness of regional economies  all regional economies  and in particular  Mr Evans  that of Wales  but not only of Wales.
And  because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission  let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre  be they remote regions  island regions or  of course  the most remote regions which are  naturally  the most distant.
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro  who asked me about this  that  as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions  the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.
Concerning the most remote regions  it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments  but this is not necessarily an excuse  just an explanation.
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and  within the College  we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.
So that is the first priority  the competitiveness of regional economies.
The second priority  which several of you have stressed  Mr Puerta in particular  but there were others  not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority  is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment  particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.
Ladies and gentlemen  we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great  proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund  but where  at the same time  in relation to unemployment - as you wrote  Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is  as it should be  unjustifiable and intolerable.
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention  as far as possible  with your support  of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social  human and territorial cohesion  particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe  a Europe of wealthy districts but  at the same time  a Europe of impoverished areas.
The third objective is urban and rural development  within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.
In fact  the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development  and let me say  Mrs Schroedter  that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport  an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.
You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership  yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.
However  I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that  as far as I am concerned  this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool  one used to involve local brainpower  be it in the public sector  in the form of elected representatives  the social and educational sectors  associations  or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership  and let me mention in this connection  in response to Mrs Angelilli  the territorial pacts  which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities  since they must be taken into consideration  under each of the objectives  to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made  ladies and gentlemen  and firstly on procedure.
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission  in the form of a draft in February 1999  in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text  my predecessor  Mrs Wulf-Mathies  presented them to Parliament immediately.
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time  however  Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted  in July 1999.
Here in this Chamber  ladies and gentlemen  among you  I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned  your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.
And let me assure you  furthermore  that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind  in line with the regulations  then the point of view of this House  as expressed in this report  will also be taken into account.
Now to the form.
On the subject of the role of the guidelines  Mrs Schroedter  you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives  often very precise ones  should be provided.
I shall not list them all  but they include implementing intersectoral policies  increasing efficiency in the use of public funds  assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together  etc. The Commission takes note of these  but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents  such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.
Drawing to a close  I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated  Mrs Schroedter.
I am thinking  for example  of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations  which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad  indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.
I actually quoted the text itself  in quotation marks.
Moreover  the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.
You then mentioned  Mrs Schroedter  the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development  pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.
I find the opposite the case.
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches  and shall attach  to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.
Indeed  I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.
As regards rural development  which a number of you brought up  particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez  the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas  but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.
It must  however  be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds  whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.
And indeed  on the subject of the balance of rural society  let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section  aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.
At this stage  I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas  in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.
In any event  I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.
Before concluding  I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France  Austria and Germany  in particular  in the last few weeks  and at the same time we shall once again be discussing  together with my fellow Commissioner  Mrs de Palacio  what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.
I shall therefore reserve the right  if you permit  sir  to give you my own opinion  which  to a great extent  matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France  Sweden  Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working  particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.
Indeed  this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.
In conclusion  with thanks for your understanding  Mr President  I should like to thank you  Mrs Schroedter  for the quality of your work and that of the committee  and to tell you that I am very pleased  apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines.
We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view. I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines  which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes.
I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions  at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken  good joint working practice  which is  Mr Hatzidakis  backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend  on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism  on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].
Mr President  Commissioner  this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.
I consider  however  that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and  unfortunately  this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.
The Commission report generally relativises this observation  particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest  by which I mean the French overseas departments and  more generally  the most remote regions.
In this respect  I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and  more specifically  to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Finally  in my view  this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe  particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion  its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.
Mr President  the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author  both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility  which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.
It must be remembered that  currently  the European Union' s overall competitiveness is  in general terms  81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units  that is the regions  also improves. Furthermore  this is at a time when technological development  economic globalisation and our problems  which are enlargement and the single currency  demand that the regions  as well as businesses and individuals  make more of an effort to be competitive.
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur  one positive and one negative.
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major  although not decisive  factor in reducing regional inequalities.
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.
This  Commissioner  is the first commandment for the coming period.
Thus  Mr President  I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission  as other speakers have done  to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.
Mr President  Commissioner  I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims. The report shows that growth has been uneven  despite all our efforts.
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe. The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average  whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences  long distances  climates that are too cold or too hot  sparse populations and austere conditions?
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.
In the future  we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.
For example  uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.
In this connection  too  weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.
Mr President  Commissioner  the European Union' s regional policy has  until now  not been able to interpret  in any significant way  the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today  there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty  as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached  on average  23.7% in the regions worst affected  regions which also happen to be poor areas  whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment  corresponding to the richer areas  unemployment stands at just 4%.
Given this situation  the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes  which are often misspent  with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems  with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks  which are due in 2007.
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries  which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies  as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs  particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality  which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.
Mr President  Commissioner  Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation  boosting equality of opportunity  increasing the sustainability of employment and development  are only mentioned in passing.
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness  particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region  that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany  and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions  that is to say job creation measures  special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development  simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.
After all  the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and  to a lesser extent  in rationalisation.
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.
In other words  what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.
For example  these would be measures for vocational training  for further education  for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process  for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements  in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.
Mr President  my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.
By stimulating a diversity of investments  the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.
From the sixth periodic report on the regions  one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase  not really a satisfying result over a period during which  certainly over the past couple of years  there has been economic growth.
As indicated by the rapporteur  the effects of the structural measures  on the other hand  are minimal as far as employment is concerned.
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.
Also  the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.
Mr President  it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities  especially in connection with boosting employment.
It is  after all  they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and  if necessary  tying this in with financial aid  a higher return can be achieved.
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.
Following on from this  it is probably also more meaningful  with regard to the financial aid to regions  to give Member States more say anyway.
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States  we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.
Finally  I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.
The report shows that  in general  they are a long way behind EU countries  especially in terms of GDP per capita.
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future  it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.
Mr President  Commissioner  following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.
For example  whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased  there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.
Equally  unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all  indeed they rose in some cases.
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment  then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development  improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term  then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.
Mr President  Commissioner  my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report  because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.
This issue  which has an impact on their everyday life  is a key issue as regards EU credibility.
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided  I would say quite magnificently  the development of poor countries.
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.
In this connection  French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words  I take my hat off to the EU.
The EU really deserves such a gesture  but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.
What is the result?
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.
Consequently  we have to build schools  hospitals  and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.
Most people  however  would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised  if they were given the chance to  in other words  if there was work there.
We must give them this opportunity.
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.
The solution  as I see it  lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business  but creating will.
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life  whether he or she is an employee  the owner of a business or an official.
What is a fair society?
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.
In this way  positive development of the regions is also possible  because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.
Finally  I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America  where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy  as it often is here in Europe.
Mr President  Commissioner  as my time is limited  I shall get straight to the point.
Firstly  let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.
The most remote regions  still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates  offer one example of this.
In Reunion  for example  the rate is 37%.
This is not a situation related to the economic climate  however; rather it is a structural problem  created by our remoteness  our insularity  in short  our own specific personality.
The principle of specific  exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.
It only remains to put this principle into practice.
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January  then February  and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.
As regards taxation  state aid  the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products  practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.
If these do not materialise  then  unfortunately  convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us  and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions  despite the size of the amounts committed  will end in failure.
Thank you very much  Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President  I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.
Firstly  I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament  as other speakers remarked yesterday  can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.
We should also have the humility to recognise that  if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission  but also by a five-year programme  we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House  so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future  we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday  I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.
Thank you very much  Mr Cox.
I understand what you are saying.
We have taken note of this.
Mr President  concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business  we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.
However  it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.
Mr Wynn  that makes sense.
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.
Mr President  regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building  I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly  but this is a serious problem.
Mrs Ahern  we have taken note of this.
I would ask you to bring this specific case  which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor  to the attention of the Quaestors  who are  in fact  responsible for the matter.
We will also pass this on to our services  however.
Thank you very much.
(The Minutes were approved)
Reform of European competition policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau  on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay  on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer  on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen  on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].
Mr President  Commissioner  today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law  that is Mr von Wogau' s report  and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper  or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .
However  we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998  and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.
But  of course  both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.
On reading both Commission documents  one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed  which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority  the Commission  with its logically consistent approach  has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition  not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.
It should continue along this path.
But  Commissioner  none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union  the deepening of the internal market  technological progress  globalisation.
Indeed  it is not just about modernisation of Community law  more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases  about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions  for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance  together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.
Only  without transparency there will be no acceptance  indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but  in fact  there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought  Commissioner  but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role  for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body  and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament  indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen  strengthening and intensifying it.
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body  but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law  of all things  is truly scandalous.
Therefore  I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases  even given the Treaty status quo.
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.
With all due respect for the principle of competition  competition is not  however  an end in itself.
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.
At the end of the day  one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses  monopolies law being one example.
But on the whole  this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.
Competition yes  restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.
However  since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like  regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report  to say one more thing about it. It is certainly possible  indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes  provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.
Mr President  Commissioner  ladies and gentlemen  the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87  88 and 89 of the Treaties.
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors  according to various typologies  such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid  on average  for the period under review  is in the order of EUR 95 billion  corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995  a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.
To put it plainly  the level of state aid declared  roughly speaking  is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent  coincidentally  of the Community budget for one year.
This being the case  there are considerable disparities between states  which may be measured in various ways  such as  for example  as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid  which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund  among other things  which come at the top of the list.
This being the case  let me now come to the proposals made in the report.
We note  first of all  that the committee considers the data  as presented in the Commission' s annual report  to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate  sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition  pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided  and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example  has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid  accessible via the Internet.
Having better  more detailed information available  particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded  must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.
And insofar as such studies already exist  to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties  which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy  but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.
By stressing  primarily  the quality of the information provided  our debate in committee  and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you  avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was  in absolute terms  either too high or not high enough.
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between  on the one hand  the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and  on the other hand  acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty  particularly  as I have said already  as regards sustainable development  research and development and economic and social cohesion.
This being the case  various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee  particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid  in view of the inadequacies  acknowledged or not  of private investment alone  the market failures or inadequacies of the market.
There is in particular one amendment  let me point out  concerning the energy sector  which  in my capacity as rapporteur  I see as particularly important.
I should like to conclude this presentation  Commissioner  by stressing two things: firstly  a concern of the members of the committee and  secondly  a demand of our committee.
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  in terms of competition policy and state aid.
This is undoubtedly a complex issue  and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter  particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and  as far as state aid is concerned  the need  in all probability  to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.
And finally  in conclusion  our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing  competition policy and state aid  in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.
As you know  Commissioner  our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.
Mr President  Commissioner  my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code  that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.
Hence  what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.
The European Commission' s decisions  which feature in the report  are welcomed by the European Parliament  as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases  thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication  which we have not yet debated in Parliament.
As in other sectors  the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.
According to this article  state aid is irreconcilable with the common market  in principle.
Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.
Under Article 88  the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.
In 1998  the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.
Furthermore  the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular  precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development  aid for environmental protection  social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.
In addition  there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.
However  there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.
As far as Parliament is concerned  it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market  regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.
Consequently  Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment  and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires  they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires  steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94  for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view  do not fall within the categories of the code  even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.
The Commission will be called upon  in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999  to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions  thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions  I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity  which we have ourselves created  in plenary sitting.
Mr President  ladies and gentlemen  the internal market is not complete.
Subsidies  monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time  but then it happens again.
Subsidies distort allocations  both within and between countries.
A successive phasing out of State aid is required  and more and more markets must be opened up to competition. This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies  both private and public.
Public monopolies are  more often than not  phased out reluctantly.
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare  including within the spheres of education  health care and social services.
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.
Europe must be modernised  made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently. In fact  competition policy and consumer policy belong together.
The internal market is the basis for our work.
Its legislation is to apply equally to all  to large and small countries alike.
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled. The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.
In order to be effective  it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.
In six months' time  it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed. There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership  which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings  at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.
In fact  in my own constituency of Stockholm  we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.
Mr President  as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today  even though there has been a delay.
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau  Mr Langen  Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer  as well as the Commission  for their excellent cooperation.
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors  where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.
All this is to the good of the consumer.
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs  at any rate.
At the same time  this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world  of course.
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing  each person will have to take responsibility themselves  and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe  then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission  by central bodies  but also by national authorities  by national courts.
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally  it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear  something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted  then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.
However  when it comes to what the future holds for competition  there are two issues dear to my heart.
One is subsidiarity.
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency  and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.
I would cite  by way of example  the issue of job creation schemes  savings banks and regional banks  and Gütesiegel.
Here  a region has  by its own efforts  created a means of marketing its own products.
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy  although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector  but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.
These days  someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.
However  I could also regard them as a customer  and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field  that is evolved structures  stifle competition.
Apart from that  I could refer to any customers  any sector  as customers  and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.
To conclude  I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes  they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.
Thank you very much  Mr Radwan.
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak  inappropriately in your case  as a maiden speech.
Mr President  Commissioner  I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member  Robert Goebbels  who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market  it would not make any difference to the real world.
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.
While  since the dawn of time  the market has been the key forum for human interchange  it has never been perfect.
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.
On the market  the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties  consumers and workers.
In order to function  the market needs rules.
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators  but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.
Finally  aid can enable restructuring  offer training  save jobs and thus know-how.
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union  particularly economic and social cohesion  sustainable development and research.
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.
The Internet is not a product of the market  but the result of research financed by the American army.
The World Wide Web  which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society  was developed by CERN in Geneva  once again with public aid.
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness  the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund  LTCM.
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is  apparently  a sin against the market  but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation  as was the case in Mexico  Asia and Brazil.
Human labour  on the other hand  is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.
Mr President  Commissioner  I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.
I want to thank you  Commissioner Monti  for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that  as we enter the new millennium  you have an especially important role. It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments.
These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy  but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann  a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and  especially  aid to shipyards.
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and  to that extent  are helping to undermine the value of the euro.
The Group of the European Liberal  Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee  all concerning state aid.
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness  which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal  Democrat and Reform Party.
As I say  our amendments concern transparency  and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful  specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?
At present  there are no common rules in this area  and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.
Finally  we propose keeping both a register  as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs  and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.
You have shown us the way  Mr Monti  with the single market scoreboard.
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.
I very much hope that you  Commissioner Monti  will support these amendments  and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.
To conclude  I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy  on which  once again  a good deal of work has been done.
But  as I have already mentioned  our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned  and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union  and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who  in his report  has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria  as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.
As Liberals and Greens  we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look  but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives  and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.
Mr President  Commissioner  there are just two questions which must be answered.
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy  and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?
Regarding the first point  we say quite clearly that  in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed  it is essential that  in some instances  there is state aid to businesses  be it in the form of tax exemptions  special taxation or even direct aid.
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements  since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.
So our clear response is that  yes  such aid and such agreements are legitimate  but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.
We feel this is relatively dangerous  but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.
Mr President  once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.
Should we not be discussing this issue?
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.
Certain sectors of European industry  such as the shipbuilding industry  air transport and the steel industry  which have been hard hit by existing competition policy  have suffered tremendously.
They have lost their status  and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.
When will we debate that?
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states  and Member States of the Union at that.
And yet  we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.
At the same time  unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded  poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition  in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.
Mr President  Commissioner  in the course of this pivotal year  prior to the changeover to the single currency  the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.
The competition policy has  as far as these resources permitted  contributed to this event.
For our part  we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which  far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency  imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket  which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.
Having said that  governing means planning. It also means being responsible and  in this new context which has been forced upon us  competition law naturally has an essential role to play.
In this area  the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices  by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.
As regards state aid  it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex  and the introduction of a public register  where all aid would be recorded  does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.
Finally  on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty  we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.
The Commission is  in fact  retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities  but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.
In conclusion  I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction  we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which  if it were realised  would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.
Mr President  Commissioner  we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition  particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation  but we are also puzzled by several things.
First of all  there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers  though necessary in many ways  will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives  and that some people will be tempted to use competition law  not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails  of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets  but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy  planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves  or even for protectionist purposes.
In this respect  we should heed the words of von Eieck  and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni  who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.
State interference in the economy is  even today  still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market  competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this  there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.
Finally  Commissioner  we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state  ranging from state television  which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer  and the Post Office  to some compulsory insurance schemes  including health and social welfare systems  which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.
Commissioner  I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties  but I believe that  it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy  especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.
What is being done may well be very important  but it is still not sufficient.
Mr President  we are holding a special debate: on competition policy and state aid  the government' s right and left hand  so to speak.
Whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to curb expenditure  the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place.
This is understandable  because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave  with adverse effects on employment.
But  at the same time  this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers' money.
In principle  only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort  or hardly distort  competition.
The rapporteur' s Amendments Nos 6 and 7  therefore  deserve our support.
Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society.
Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit.
Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies.
If this comes to nothing  then the government has to step in.
The Commission' s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper.
The plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the Directorate-General on Competition is a kind gesture  but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stretched.
This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry.
Does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission?
What is the Council' s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points?
Mr President  a White Paper  by definition  is not something you can take or leave.
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.
I also assume that you  Commissioner  want to honour the reputation of  and the work put in by  your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner  but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.
Firstly  these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.
In general  I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy  not only in terms of concept  but also in terms of application.
It is true  there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.
So  I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.
Secondly  I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.
In the White Paper  you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines  but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?
Thirdly  I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection  as is already the case  one has got to admit  within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.
Fourthly  I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.
Fifthly  with the pending enlargement  I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.
They are still in training  as it were.
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?
Sixthly and lastly  I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions  namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives  it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?
Commissioner  I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that  in this sense  we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.
Mr President  I would like  in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper  to congratulate the rapporteur  Mr von Wogau.
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.
We are  therefore  in agreement with the report  Commissioner  as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.
Since the Treaty entered into force  Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.
After almost forty years of being in force  these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion.
For this reason  modernisation was essential.
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons.
Firstly  the authorisation system; secondly  decentralised application; thirdly  procedural rules; fourthly  judicial application; and fifthly and finally  excessive red tape.
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform  as was unanimously requested by specialised companies  academics and lawyers.
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.
A system  such as the current one  which is capable of making so few decisions  be they approvals or prohibitions  is something less than a valid system.
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.
However  they could not apply Article 81(3)  which  to a certain extent  prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice  both brought by German courts  which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure  that it did not establish time limits  that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files  or that the right to defence was not properly recognised  were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994  the Commission published a communication on this subject.
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition  consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.
Amongst these  firstly  is the fact that  despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82  Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight. At the moment  with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them  the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.
Secondly  Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.
For these reasons  we are going to vote in favour of the report.
However  if some of the amendments are accepted  particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group  we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document  lacking in rigour and  in that event  we would reconsider our support.
Mr President  amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate  I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer  that is to say  the modernisation of competition policy  which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.
Frankly  I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.
Through his management  Commissioner Monti achieves good results  as did his predecessor and  clearly  he has established a guarantee which  in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market  has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately  without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged  as has happened in the European Union since 1993.
If it functions well  if we are satisfied  if the Commission has basically acted correctly  why the need for the modification?
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis  justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition  but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States  are truly identical in all regions.
Because  if this is not the case  we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.
In that event we would not have moved forward  but rather backwards  in the application of competition policy in the Union.
Mr President  I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union  when compared to previous reports.
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur  Mr Rapkay  who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country  which I represent - a margin for action  by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.
Nevertheless  I cannot forget the numerous criticisms  both from Member States and from market operators  which  given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases  maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment  the planning of company mergers etc.
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval  through individual cases  which will take more than six or eight months to resolve  an excessively long period  which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility  affecting the generation of wealth and employment.
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations  lay down clear rules  which will benefit all of us: businesspeople  investors  workers and the citizens in general.
Mr President  I would like to stress that  in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.
From the point of view of economic growth  and therefore of increasing employment and wealth  safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor  and one that is certainly very important for our future.
This is why I give this report my full support.
Recently  I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner  precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility  both for products and for services.
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future  for Europe' s economy  and  above all  for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.
Mr President  for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament  I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.
But all this  in effect  is so much rhetoric when we look at the national  regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.
But he would recognise that  as for everybody else  we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination.
That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs  Mr von Wogau.
I want to congratulate him  sadly in his absence  for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.
So although I may not share his conclusions  I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.
I know that the Commission is set against this  but the potential exists.
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities. I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.
Well  we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment  in which we have the support of the Commission.
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point  in the Factortame case  in which the British Government was the defendant  it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.
So  judicially  something needs to be done.
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.
In relation to legal certainty  I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.
It is important that business has legal certainty.
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.
We all have  as it were  our histories to live with  but it is important that business has legal certainty.
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.
We have been told how  currently  people's time is being wasted and that the changes  therefore  could be beneficial.
But I really feel that  in the circumstances  we want to know what the implications would be for business.
Finally  we  as British Conservatives  are looking for a change in direction  towards the development of an independent competition authority.
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.
Mr President  the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.
It is an integral part of the tension  inherent in the very concept of European integration  between solidarity and cooperation between Member States  with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy  and competition  which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.
We can be proud of a European competition culture  for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.
However  we must be vigilant in the face of global operators  against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier  who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check  not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan  or others  until we get the international competition law we so badly need.
European competition policy  as we very often forget  is not just important for fair competition as such  but also for prices  growth and employment  and hence for the public.
In common with the other Members  I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament  as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations  consumer protection associations and the public.
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.
Then it is possible to understand that  for example  lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy  and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are  of course  bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.
At the same time  it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose  with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.
I am opposed to this  unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group  because I believe that  in competition policy terms  the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met  and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.
The system currently in force creates transparency  affords enterprises legal certainty and has  without a shadow of a doubt  led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.
Indeed  it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.
Mr President  I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.
For example  the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion  which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy  which I hope it will be able to meet because  for certain  many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element  and  particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.
Mr President  in the limited time I have  I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here  in particular by Mr Jonckheer  who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82  especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.
As a Member for the Basque Country  I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general  and Mr Monti  in particular  for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature  foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union  and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who  by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law  are subject to those rules.
Mr President  Commissioner  competition is exactly what we need.
We need competition if there is the least unemployment  for a smooth-running healthcare system  for social justice  for high social standards  and  of course  we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products  equal market access conditions for all enterprises  and environmentally-friendly products.
In other words  we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.
I often have the impression  unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded  that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg  although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.
But these are competitive jobs  for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle  by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time  would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are  of course  dependent on too.
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.
To that end  we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.
Mr President  ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy  Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus.
This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.
Mr President  the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory  something I would wholeheartedly agree with.
But opinion differs as to the solution.
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.
In other words  we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.
We would be changing the law to make it executable again  which is something I consider to be unacceptable.
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption  insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words  the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.
This is unacceptable to my mind.
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.
This is unacceptable in my view.
It would weaken a key element of European policy.
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.
In any case  the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.
There was no majority for this at the time.
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time  it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.
Forty years on  this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies  to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.
I consider this to be unacceptable.
Mr President  in this important debate on competition  I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996  the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.
Indeed  several years ago  this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses  even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.
This indeed  is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code  but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets  hence the importance of regulating such aid.
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research  development  environmental protection and cases of company closure.
In the same category of ideas  it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines. I agree with this request.
Like the rapporteur  while I am pleased with the Commission report  nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way  the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.
In the interests of equality  either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.
Finally  and in conclusion  Mr President  with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty  the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002  and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.
We therefore await  and I await  the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.
Mr President  I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen  which concerns aid to the steel industry.
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.
Firstly  I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and  secondly  on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that  despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code  the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.
However  the thing that worries us most  Mr President  is the decrease in prices  by 30%  owing to imports.
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan  in the case of steel  as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically  resulting in a loss of jobs.
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.
With global markets  we need global employment laws and global subsidies.
I know this is difficult to achieve now  but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers  here and elsewhere  and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries  here and elsewhere  it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.
Mr President  Commissioner  Director-General  I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules  and to propose practical reform measures.
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau  who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification  indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken  and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection  discussion  and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves  the judiciary  the Member States  and above all the SMEs concerned  that need to be clarified.
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.
However  it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.
I also welcome  therefore  the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual  without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.
In practice  only 9 cases were rejected  94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished  non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines  which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related  staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement
To conclude  I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions  legal certainty for all enterprises  consistent application of competition policy  procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop  coordination of the national - and to me  independent - competition authorities  close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission  along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law  and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.
I am in suspense as to how the discussions  which were broadly based  will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.
The Commission report confirms that  with the exception of Germany  state aid to businesses is increasing.
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.
As far as we are concerned  we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.
Take  for example  the car manufacturing sector  where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.
With what aim?
Not to save jobs.
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.
Not to improve working conditions  for in increasing production with fewer workers  working conditions are made worse.
Did these firms need state aid to survive?
No  car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.
State aid is not only counterproductive because  as the Jonckheer report acknowledges  it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another  but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced  public services are being abandoned  hospitals are being closed.
In voting against the Jonckheer report  I wish to assert the need for another policy  to wit  ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.
Mr President  today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.
In accordance with the principle of competition  the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94  competition policy in the strict sense  and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.
Firstly  fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently  thanks to Commissioner Monti  there have been direct provisions  the code of good conduct in particular.
This has worked fairly well  but  as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.
Firstly  it is necessary  in drawing up the legislation  to produce clear and complete rules.
It is probably horrendous  especially in this particular raft of legislation  that there are confused rules  regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.
Thirdly  it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission  in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.
Fourthly  and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards  employment standards  in order to prevent dumping in this area  and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid  which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up  we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid  internal distortions by other countries  from being transferred to the international arena  in other words  through trickery.
Mr President  Commissioner Monti  there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.
Many of the report' s conclusions  however  are cause for concern  at least for our group.
For example  the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages  thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective  uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.
The form the aid takes is important.
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.
For example  state guarantees  on which the Commission has just publicised its position  must naturally be considered state aid  but they are  in my opinion  a better option than granting aid directly to companies.
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency  which affects competitiveness.
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy  real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth  not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.
In my opinion  it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator  which will water down all the aims of competition policy.
Mr President  Mr Monti  the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union  not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years  but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.
I would like to thank the rapporteur  Mr von Wogau  for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.
Moreover  I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro  Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority  sent me  and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement  which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.
In my opinion  we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses  which bind the European economy together  and social protection  which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade  pure and simple  and a system for improving people' s quality of life.
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands  all of which must be protected.
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries  precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.
Mr President  competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition  marked by clear  uniform rules.
In his report  Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.
But Europe is changing.
The economies are growing  we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.
This is not in question.
Having said this  I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.
How will the Commission  as keeper of the Treaties  guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London  Palermo  Helsinki and  soon  Budapest and Ankara?
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented  and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.
It is not enough to say that  in the Member States  there is already 40 years' worth of experience.
In the Netherlands  the competition authority is still in its infancy.
This country has a very small market which  unfortunately  is often at the same time defined as the relevant market.
This in contrast to Germany  where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.
The European Commission' s belief that  in all quarters of the Union  legislation will  almost as a matter of course  be interpreted in the same way  is what  within catholic circles  we term "foolhardy " and this is not allowed.
Uniformity needs to be worked on.
Think of specialist  national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.
Moreover  due to the immense economic and social interests involved  we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event  as is now quite normal.
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security  the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that  alongside vertical exemptions  horizontal exemptions will also be possible.
Through cooperation  small  independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.
Moreover  regarding these small businesses  we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in  the yellow card  instead of an immediate red card  which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.
Mr President  being the last to speak gives me the privilege  Commissioner  of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total  and  I believe  justified  confidence in you at the helm of this boat.
But we all want to be oarsmen on it. We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.
Firstly  there is the concern that some have expressed  in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath  President of the Committee on Economic Affairs  of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.
Secondly  we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.
It is true  Commissioner  that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.
We all agree on this.
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses  and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas  of legitimising the nature of the internal market.
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.
There have only been nine rejections.
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project  in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante  changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.
Thirdly  we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.
In this respect  the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.
I believe that biodiversity is good  as is cultural diversity  but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market  that is to say  competition law.
Here improvements should be made.
Only in certain countries  Germany for example  is there specialised jurisdiction.
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore  but we must also explore others.
What we cannot do  Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way  and give ammunition  to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good  of the rich  and not of the citizen  or the small and medium business  which  in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements  very late  with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant"  that is to say  after Lord knows how many years  when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement  a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.
Commissioner  it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.
It transcends competition  it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration  the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.
Therefore  Commissioner  we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.
Mr President  ladies and gentlemen  I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.
In my opinion  Mr President  this joint debate fully bears this out.
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy  a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy  which we shall have the opportunity to address together  aims to ensure more effective protection of competition  reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.
I  personally  would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission  but  on the contrary  fundamental contributions  since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules  the risk of renationalisation  consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.
The current notification instrument  ladies and gentlemen  no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that  in 35 years  there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which  in the majority of cases  receive a simple comfort letter.
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition  primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions  also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements  and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges  whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.
The question of renationalisation: first of all  although it is not really necessary  I would like to point out and stress  several times if I may  that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that  as far as Regulation 17 is concerned  there is a risk of renationalisation.
Of course we have pondered this issue  and we are still studying it extremely carefully  and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.
At the end of the day  I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities  but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term  used by Mrs Randzio-Plath  and  moreover  I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.
So  the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive  and they are certainly not all the same.
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned  permitting greater use of Community law  which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation  not renationalisation  of competition law.
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind  but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.
As with many other provisions of the Treaty  Articles 81(1) and 82 have  after all  been applied for decades by national authorities and judges  and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.
In a directly applicable exception system  consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework  both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.
Secondly  we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes  and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.
In this respect  I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on  it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns  Mrs Peijs.
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses  it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is  after all  to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen  Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.
Many speakers have underlined this.
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.
Why?
Is this simply a political gesture?
No.
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations  as in the field of vertical restraints.
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs  and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs  first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system  and secondly  by making Article 81(3) directly applicable  which will benefit SMEs in particular.
The fourth group is legal certainty. Mr Evans  legal certainty is  of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses  not just for the legal professions  although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject  the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market  Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi  emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market  including  in this case  competition.
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3)  it will permit authorisation  without a prior decision  of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982  as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.
(IT) I shall now quickly turn  Mr President  to Mr Rapkay' s report  and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.
I will mention only two  in order to be brief.
The first is greater transparency.
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy  as I did right from the moment I had my hearing  on 1 September  in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
As regards the international aspect of competition policy  I can confirm  Mr Rapkay  that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject  to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention.
We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American  Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy  and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.
Mr Jonckheer  I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.
I will not talk about codecision here  but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion  and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.
With regard to your suggestions  Mr Jonckheer  you already know that my staff  who  although short-handed as usual  are fortunately highly qualified  are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey  which  according to the scheduled timeframe  should be being drawn up by the staff now  in January  and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000  to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.
Mr Jonckheer  Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.
I can only say very briefly  that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations  they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.
I can also say  in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which  as you know  I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.
In connection with the issue of State aid  I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen  among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.
In April 1999  the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.
Finally  Mr President  I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report  which  although geared more towards a specific sector  is a valuable contribution.
I would like to say that  as we know  the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure  pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty  but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector  which will come into force in July 2002  we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied  and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form  I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.
So  Mr President  I will walk away from this debate  for which I am very grateful to Parliament  in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support  which appears to come from all sides of the House  for competition policy  its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.
I am especially grateful for all of this. We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs  and  at a more general level  with Parliament.
In this regard  I liked your term  Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together  preferably in the same direction.
Competition is not an end in itself  as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out  but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate  at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social  as well as economic  role in the European integration process  as it has done in the past.
Thank you  Commissioner Monti.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato  on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control  containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.
Mr President  year after year we learn  mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports  that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage  mismanagement  and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.
For some time now  these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money  which  when all is said and done  is what sustains the Union' s budget.
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud  to detecting it  punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps  as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.
So far  efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States  together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.
What is more  the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.
For it to enter into force  it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.
After five years only four have done so.
This state of deadlock  which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union  has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority  rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests  that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market  as articulated in its position  together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights  Justice and Home Affairs  will also be taken full account of in this process.
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency  transparency  and the protection of the rights of individuals.
In addition  we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests  and in which main principles are firmly established.
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission  for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks  which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests  and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.
In addition  we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union  where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts  the so-called corpus juris  and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.
The Commission  Mr Barnier  Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.
I call upon you  ladies and gentlemen  to vote in favour of this report  which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.
We can set another example here  to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular  fraud  and to mete out punishment where necessary.
Mr President  I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well  and the result  which we have received today  is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area. This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand  least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought.
The Treaty is a collection of complex articles. However  this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.
At the same time  it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests  as Mrs Theato has explained very well.
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.
As the French say  "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water]  that is to say  in the protection of the Community' s financial interests  we must respect  on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States  but also other matters which affect the citizens  which affect the essential guarantees.
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.
Therefore  in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market  and  of course  as an MEP  I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.
Mr President  this  as Mrs Theato said  is a critical report.
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because  whether we like it or not  the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement.
It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. We need to do something about it.
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests  and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.
We need to take this responsibility seriously.
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.
The question is: who prosecutes?
That is where we really get into difficulty.
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.
Of most importance to Parliament  as the guardian of the budget of the European Union  is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted  and that is not the case at the moment.
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here  no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.
Mr President  I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report. I think it is a first-class report which will  for the most part  be supported by my group.
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months  this could well be the case.
We all know that  in 1995  it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.
But the Member States failed to cooperate.
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present  I think.
It is now possible  on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty  that the Commission will take new initiatives  and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.
Unlike the previous speaker  who has now disappeared  my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga  will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.
I think what we need is  at European level  to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong  especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union  then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.
This  I thought  is no longer permissible  certainly not at the moment.
I would like to make one general point on politics.
Whatever we may say about the European elections  the low turnout is a fact.
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly  and this must be done at European level.
Mr President  I too would like to thank the rapporteur.
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of  bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.
Yet  every year we have the same problem.
The Court of Auditors publishes its report  which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.
So far  however  the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here  to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.
It is important that after the first step  which has already been taken  i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF  in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this  which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees  also for suspects.
Having said all that  I must say that unfortunately  my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.
Unfortunately  however  people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.
Mr President  we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled  even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties  so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea  but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.
Indeed  we are talking about criminal law  the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is  and will be  fierce.
Indeed  it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.
In any case  this idea must be encouraged  and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.
On behalf of my group  but also personally  I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees  which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.
Therefore  on behalf of my group  I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.
Mr President  Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor  on the other hand  aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.
Moreover  this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.
According to the Theato report  the European Public Prosecutor is needed  in particular  in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office  OLAF.
At the same time  however  we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.
In this way  a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one  and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one  as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then  why not a European Minister of Justice  supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform  which appears to be quite specific.
In the final analysis  we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form  organised around a superstate.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group  on the other hand  wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities  for example  and the creation  if necessary  of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.
So the legal framework  Mr President  is already in place.
It is fine  in principle. It need only be fine-tuned.
Mr President  Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.
Public opinion  although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows  is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI  the European police  in the form of OLAF.
All this would be established by two regulations  one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty  i.e. based on secondary law  whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.
And indeed there is a twofold shift.
Firstly  the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift  a single market  a single VAT  a single diplomatic service  a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion  while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences  free trade areas  customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource  GDP  as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North  the Europe of the Lutherans  Calvinists and Quakers  wishes to inflict its moral order on us.
Basically  the more we lose our grip on morals  the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.
Mr President  it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union  more so these days than there used to be.
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.
Now it is  of course  possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda  it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.
Now that is not a contradiction  since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law  as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report  is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests  which  as far as that goes  does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary  it protects them  at least indirectly.
The compatibility with the various national systems of law  as confirmed by experts  shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common  for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.
Taking these aspects into account  I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind  as proposed  and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.
Mr President  will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?
I do not believe so.
On the other hand  we can go a long way using the existing tools.
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust  as proposed at the last Summit.
In the way it is structured  Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.
OLAF  Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and  when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States  we can also achieve a lot with this.
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.
It is simply too bad  and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.
However  it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.
It is  after all  only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law.
Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.
Instead  there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and  especially  change our practice.
At the moment  Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!
Mr President  we all want to do something about combating European fraud.
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but  in reality  we have made little progress.
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States  as was stated before  have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.
So a great deal has to be done in this area.
And what exactly should be done?
Two things  and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.
Firstly  the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.
So  unification in this small area.
Secondly  we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks  firstly to assist the national public prosecutors  helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and  secondly  to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of. I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.
It is  in fact  something very positive.
Just like Europol.
Europol  involving police cooperation  does not rank above the national police forces  but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.
This is exactly the task which a small  limited  European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out  not just at the criminal investigation stage  but also at the prosecution stage.
Parliament supports this.
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.
Mr President  I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists  with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time  Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado  said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.
We need a public debate on this.
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.
Mr President  on behalf of the Italian Radical Members  I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control  because I share the concerns that have been voiced  in such an authoritative way  by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue  since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed  to be crushed.
Nevertheless  the way in which our committee intends to see this text through  with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair  Mrs Theato  will not be without its critics.
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.
Nevertheless  we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality  without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say  they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.
Mr President  we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament  during the plenary sittings and in the committees  even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture  the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events  which in the past seemed to be the norm.
Today  something has changed  at least in terms of mechanisms  and especially as regards monitoring  but we are still not satisfied  particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor  crimes  fraud  the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests  its image and its relationship with taxpayers  who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.
For this reason  it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests  and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.
In this respect  we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.
Today  we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.
Mr President  I would very much just like to add to two particular points.
Firstly  I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States  although I am very much in favour of having such a debate  for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion  but I digress.
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2. After all  there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor  rather  for legal reasons it has now become an independent  European authority  or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.
Nothing has changed there.
As has always been the case  there are offences that transcend European offences  as it were  or at least there is the potential for them to do so  and these might include money-laundering  receiving stolen goods  and forming a criminal organisation.
As far as that is concerned  I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.
Mr President  for years  Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which  five years after being signed  has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.
On the other hand  more pro-active attempts  such as OLAF  which is currently operating  have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection  under criminal law  of our financial interests  which would criminalise certain activity  specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF  without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.
Finally  following on from what was agreed in Tampere  the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role  which everyone considers vital.
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions  by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.
Nevertheless  it raises some very basic questions.
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying  in legal terms  the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which  although it might be called subsidiary  will always clash with the practice  and in certain areas  with the traditional  separate criminal law of the Member States?
As there are doubts  would it not be more advisable  from a political point of view  to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda  and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom  security and justice?
Mr President  the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged. To remedy this  vigorous efforts are required.
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.
At the same time  we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.
On the other hand  I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.
In the present situation  I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor  which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.
We have more confidence in Eurojust  where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but  rather  that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is  however  to find the right mix.
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which  through an exaggerated supervision of detail  prevents the development of a modern administration.
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness  decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.
The major challenge is  therefore  to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.
This requires staff training  more modern recruitment methods and  above all  openness and public control.
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.
Mr President  rapporteur  restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.
Parliament is committed to this task  which is something this report bears impressive witness to.
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do  in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change  to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty  all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment. Yet as things stand  only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
A legislative act  a directive  in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility  and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective  may enable us to take a major step forwards  and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.
OLAF  the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.
Accordingly  the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks  the ECB and the EIB  contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations  citing their independent status.
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting  and I hope that Parliament approves this step.
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF  which was set up at the same time as OLAF  to safeguard the independence of OLAF  however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.
In other words  there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.
No  there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority  and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.
As such  I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support  also in its present form.
Thank you  Commissioner Schreyer.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
VOTE
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).
Mr President  on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4).
These are both about voting.
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes  the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then  if there is some doubt  should we utilise the electronic voting system?
That is quite right  Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.
In this particular case  I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.
Mr President  I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands  so to speak  but go straight to the electronic voting system.
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.
I know it takes longer  but should we not always have a show of hands first?
I shall  I assure you  Mr Heaton-Harris  pay particular attention to the show of hands.
I hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote.

Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen  on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources

(FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP  especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy  which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.
Since then  Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP  the taxable basis for the fourth resource  have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.
Since then  of course  this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is  but which it refuses to see itself as.
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources  the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.
Furthermore  the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code"   the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force  with OLAF.
There is as yet no federal European tax.
All the same  a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income  if not on profits  or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.
In recent years  the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably  increasing the risk of accidents.
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.
It therefore proved necessary  in the context of establishing the internal market  to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged  quite rightly  to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention  whether road  rail or inland waterway transport is involved.
In order to facilitate achieving this objective  Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation  regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.
While this represented significant progress at the time  the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised  high-level training of safety advisers  but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training  with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised. It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.
Parliament voted in favour of this text. It did  however  table a number of amendments  most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position  particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .
In order to be realistic  I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users  to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.
Essentially  my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that  in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods  we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.
In line with the usual procedure  it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area  and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR)  applicable throughout Europe  whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted. Consequently  the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems  rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements  as should have been the case!
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail  except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.
Until then  there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted  and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.
They may  therefore  continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation  where there are no applicable European standards.
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.
In offering this explanation of my vote  therefore  I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)
Mr President  I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.
Not only the difference in income per capita but  above all  large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.
Despite the fact that the Community  through the structural funds among others  injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe  these disparities continue to exist.
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and  based on very strict evaluations  change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.
Mr President  in relation to the Schroedter report  I am aware  and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier  that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report  I have this important reservation.
The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster  I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.
For example  we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public  private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.
Once again  there is active participation from groups from the private  public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006  other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes. They must promote a decentralised  efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national  European and local funding.
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.
In order to reduce disparities between regions  of course.
But more especially because  even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy  it may also be a source of inequality.
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model  which we are all in favour of  and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.
This is a real political objective  alongside economic and monetary affairs  drawn up in collaboration with Member States  regions and local communities  with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.
This is why I shall support this report  despite regretting the fact that  for timetabling reasons  the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States  regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1  2 and 3.
Moreover  I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs  adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion  support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved  chiefly those involved at a local level  who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems  hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships  which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States  which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.
In order to do so  the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament  associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report  they are a step in the right direction.
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006  but that is another subject.
In the meantime  let us support this first step.
This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim  I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.
In my mind  illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry  we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans  then we must have a level playing field.
Illegal state aid  by contrast  destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.
There are  of course  cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate  for example helping companies restructure.
In all such cases  however  strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry  EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.
Much remains to be done  however  and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity  given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.
Unfortunately  the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions  of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.
The truth is though  that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.
On the other hand  it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity  and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development  for small and medium-sized enterprises  for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas  specifically in the field of social housing  with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities  we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled  or rather in some cases  as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones  paradoxically  disparities are being exacerbated  particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules  the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.
In the first place  if administrative procedures are not simplified  it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform  with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.
In this respect  the Commission document has shortcomings  as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities  and for their funding  execution and monitoring.
SMEs  micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators"   given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States  including Italy  are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.
In view of this  in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report)  the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact  it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States  and it published the guidelines back in July 1999  even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties  thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.
This is why the mid-term review  provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99  will be of considerable importance.
In general  the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies  and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement  so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities  or candidate countries.
That said  the differing approach adopted in the guidelines  which are not geared to geographical objectives  but rather to policy areas  can be considered as positive.
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions  we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows  in practice  a policy of integrated interventions  for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.
We could then  theoretically  also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States  with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level  but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which  owing to a whole string of converging negative factors  have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels  with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could  in fact  amount to a negative intervention.
The guidelines  as adopted by the Commission  are very limited because  instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance  they are providing a shopping list of possible measures  a shopping list which  as it fails to set priorities in ascending order  could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.
We could say that  in this state of affairs  we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and  hence the destruction of the countryside.
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument  which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and  moreover  would accord proper status to local bodies which  being independent  could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly  and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency  concentration and administrative reform.
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in  by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal  rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs  which are no longer solely connected with agriculture  in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also  for instance  in rural tourism  sport and cultural activities  environmental projects  SMEs  services  and so on.
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".
I must also stress that once again the Commission is  in fact  skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.
In conclusion  the document is not particularly satisfactory  and in some aspects is disappointing.
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)
(PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.
Firstly  and as the Commission itself states  it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies  with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States  which is what the report proposes.
Finally  but no less importantly  I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that  in future  this type of report should also include  amongst other issues  an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.
(FR) The Berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union.
Nonetheless  the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein.
Paragraph 26  for example  "Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union" .
At a time when  in order to fulfil the convergence criteria  Member States are forced to undergo a strict budgetary slimming regime  one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative  the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony.
As an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU  the lack of results is put down to the lack of money  with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent.
What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations  rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects?
Expenditure becomes an end in itself  evidence of the success of a programme.
The statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show  as Mr Berend pointed out  the limitations of the policy being implemented:
The relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the European Union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996  testifying to a concentration of wealth  jobs and activity in certain areas: Hamburg  Brussels  Antwerp  Luxembourg  the Paris region  Darmstadt  Oberbayern  Bremen  Vienna  Karlsruhe and Emilia-Romagna.
Quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated  the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerbate the exodus of population from the most outlying  the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the central axes of the Union (the Benelux countries  North West Germany  Northern Italy  the Parisian region  etc).
The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment.
In 1986  the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41% of the overall Community GNP. In 1996 it was 50%.
Progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland.
In fact  if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor  then it seems that the middle-range regions  covered by Objective 2  are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their GNP  and a worsening of the employment situation.
This phenomenon is particularly marked in France: the GNP of the Champagne-Ardennes region  which it is my honour to represent  has gone from 105% to 94% of the Community average  that of the Loire region has dropped from 95% to 91%  and that of the Auvergne from 89% to 83%.
This is a generalised tendency  sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes  nor Alsace.
It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland  countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years  as in many regions of the United Kingdom.
It may therefore seem strange that  when the Structural Funds were reformed  Objective 2  dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring  should have been sacrificed in favour of Objectives 1 and 3. For the period 1999-2006  the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22.5 billion  a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999.
The rural regions eligible under Objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation: in France  27% of the populations eligible for Structural Funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period  a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the Loire region  Alsace or Lower Normandy  political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government.
Based as it is on such choices  it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union.
von Wogau Report (A5-0069/1999)
Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment  the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.
The management of ABB Alsthom Power  following a merger carried out in June 1999  announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions  particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council  in existence since 1996.
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment  the environment and consumers into consideration.
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect  I abstained.
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy  the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however  still remain within the notification system.
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy  moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice  and even aims at having specialised courts.
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.
On the other hand  as the rapporteur points out  in the name of competition policy  public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies  with the privatisation of important industries and public companies  as has happened in Portugal  with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.
- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy  as some Members of the European Parliament fear.
But it does  at least  make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.
In fact  taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade  and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States  the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements  and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.
The most remarkable thing  in my view  is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily  and virtually automatically  requires reform of the centralised system.
Admittedly  this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.
Indeed  the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.
Moreover  the von Wogau report  which the European Parliament has just voted on  supports it in so doing.
But at the same time  one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.
Is this not  indeed  what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because  in their view  it might break up European policy on competition  which is to say  in plain terms  attacking the standardising superstate.
Curiously  a number of employers agreed with them  preferring the European "one-stop" system  which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.
Indeed  this is one advantage of the present system.
But  on the other hand  the wider view must also be taken  namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may  in the long term  lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account  and this will be of benefit to everyone.
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other  which constantly takes the form of layoffs  factory closures  not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union  despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous  for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment  nothing to protect employees  nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions  and still less of improving them.
(FR) In voting against this report  we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services  in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster  killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle  for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere  culture or cooperation with the third world  excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?
We are convinced that the opposite is true  and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule  what criteria of efficiency?
Finally  after Seattle  do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)
(FR) I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU  and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report  and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information  both general and specific  publicly accessible via its website.
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.
Admittedly  an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.
However  as the rapporteur pointed out  such aid is occasionally essential and may  in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm  make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty)  services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).
Clearly though  it must be monitored  a task which falls to the European Commission.
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997  including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.
This aid is considerably less than the previous period  1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.
Like the rapporteur  I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time  which is to say in time for the ninth report.
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.
In order to compensate for this situation  the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another  with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment  industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)
(FR) In the important debate on competition this morning  I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996  the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable  even though Article 4(c)  of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.
This  indeed  is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.
At the same time  it is  of course  essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets  hence the importance of regulating such aid.
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development  environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.
In the same way  it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings  as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or  at least  annually  without the need for reminders.
Like the rapporteur  I am pleased with the Commission report  but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way  the Commission has  on a number of occasions  authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.
In the interests of equality  there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.
Finally  we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report  and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Oil slick off the French coast
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President  I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group  but also as an elected representative for Brittany  and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group  we tabled a motion for a resolution.
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue  firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe  with extremely serious consequences for tourism  people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists  and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline  and why?
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act  which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities  as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable  and is more restrictive  and  more especially  more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and  in particular  the existence of the American coastguard.
If  I repeat  we had had regulations of this type  then this disaster would surely not have occurred.
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed  particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners  in this case the oil tanker charterer  from any liability.
Well  if the charterer is exonerated  then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.
The regulations must therefore be reviewed  and I thank you  Commissioner  for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.
Moreover  as you said  monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state  that of the classification societies.
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.
What are the conditions for this recognition?
What guarantees are there of its reliability?
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.
We await the outcome with great interest.
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence  let me remind you  which stipulates a minimum for inspection  that is  one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.
Why not?
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for  in this case  the oil company.
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment  then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.
Finally  we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.
Firstly  I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team. This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation  and last but not least  the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union  not just certain areas of it?
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which  as our resolution points out  causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards  we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress  just as the Braer did.
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster  just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again  later on this year  discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.
The time for resolutions has passed. What is now needed is action.
Sadly  I fear  the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.
Mr President  every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea  but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected  but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400 000 birds  perhaps mainly guillemots  may have died.
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks  but the question is  how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year  were a similar incident  just as devastating  to take place  if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.
Mr President  Commissioner  I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide  the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.
With every tide  the volunteers  members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick  sticky  black tar.
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika  like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey  moreover  is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster  despite our saying at the time and many times since  "Never again!"
It is  of course  the responsibility of policies  and therefore our responsibility  to guarantee the safety of sea transport.
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.
But  listening to you  Commissioner  we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992  I believe  the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.
Indeed  we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.
This is why it is essential  as a matter of urgency  for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.
We should be aware  for example  that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.
Why  in these circumstances  is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance  at last  of the ban on degassing at sea.
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.
In addition  it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO  as a matter of urgency.
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if  once they are at sea  most vessels do just what they wish?
Finally  a compassionate thought for all the volunteers  nature lovers and bird lovers  who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds  organising rescue operation with the means available.
I can testify to this remarkable work.
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick  which is a major ecological disaster  practically unprecedented in scale.
In relation to this  you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.
And  on this subject  Commissioner  you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.
Once again  there will be no clearly defined party responsible.
In the meantime  it is nature that is taking the rap  as always.
Mr President  my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster  affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.
Let me  in this connection  welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque  spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire"   made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.
As the European Parliament  we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and  at the same time  demanding tightening up of the quality criteria  on the European and international scale  of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport  stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year  15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.
This is no longer tolerable.
Next  we have flags of convenience.
According to the International Transport Federation  over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience  the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.
This is no longer tolerable.
Finally  there is the lack of transparency.
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility  the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.
This is no longer tolerable.
In all these respects we must ensure real  significant change  including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards  including the mandatory double hull  on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.
This is an approach  Mr President  which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.
In so doing  it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which  in this instance  is awaiting clear  tangible action.
Mr President  Commissioner  as a Member for the French Atlantic coast  for Vendée  I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters  caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us  but by a crime.
In this emergency  in this ordeal  we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity  national solidarity  and intergovernmental solidarity.
What the stricken populations are waiting for now  those who have lost everything  particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism  those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come  is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused  but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.
Quite clearly  we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.
Because our states  with the blessing of the Community  did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear  we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience  drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility  irresponsible charterers  untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.
Obviously  such matters should be handled at world level  but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose  and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter  despite previous disasters.
Admittedly  there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund  IOPCF  but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level  which must be reviewed.
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience  that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.
In addition  there are Community directives  but they are seldom applied  if at all  due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years  but it is making very slow progress.
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.
This must be brought forward.
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.
Firstly  the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil  criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.
Secondly  the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.
Thirdly  a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear  strict and trenchant  then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory  in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.
Thus  the Erika was refused access to American waters.
If the European Community had done the same  a great disaster would have been avoided.
Let us ensure  Mr President  Commissioner  that this time we really do learn the lesson  even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.
Mr President  Torrey Canyon  Olympic Bravery  Haven  Amoco Cadiz  Gino  Tanio  so many names we remember with horror.
And now the Erika.
Whose turn is next?
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz  this umpteenth oil slick  the seventh since 1967  shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react  for their capitulation to the multinationals.
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept  and why Europe  normally so quick to pass environmental legislation  has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.
And this is the result.
The Erika  a vessel flying a Maltese flag  a floating rust bucket  classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers  has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline  a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region  unfortunately  I can testify to this.
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters  they are the result of fate.
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.
What we have here is an ecological disaster.
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism  fishermen  oyster farmers  shellfish farmers  people who make a living from the salt marshes  shopkeepers  etc.
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.
First of all  we must shed some light on this shipwreck.
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?
Next  as a matter of urgency  we muss pass legislation  firstly  regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.
In fact  according to the experts  the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.
We know what actually happened.
Next  reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience  make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials  work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.
This would be a minimum requirement  I believe  on the dawn of the third millennium.
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters  the responsibility of polluters  shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays"   maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing  thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required  an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and  in the meantime  Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.
Mr President  in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.
It is particularly bad this time  not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks.
The 15 clearly do not suffice.
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again.
All those involved  including the transport agent  are responsible for any ensuing damage  and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.
However  we must aim higher in the long-term  let there be no mistake about that.
In other words  we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.
Mr President  may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear  adequate and  at the same time  very firm response.
Many thanks for this.
This also means that  in any case  I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level  nature and the environment come off second-best.
The damage suffered  also in ecological terms  cannot be expressed in money.
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.
During the Christmas break  when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster  I had a look  just out of interest  on the Internet to see what arrangements were  in fact  already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures  especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.
What I learned is that  actually  there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?
First of all  the port-state control  according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place.
So this 25% should be increased.
Furthermore  if a ship is no longer seaworthy  not only should the facts be examined  but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.
But this is not in place.
Mr President  I would welcome some action in this area.
Finally  as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned  some Members have already mentioned just now that  since 1999 in the United States  ships should in any case be double-hulled.
In my opinion  we should look further into this point  and I also think that the Marpol Treaty  which comes into effect in 2001  should be looked at very closely.
Mr President  I would like to take a brief  critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to  and admiration for  the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.
Mr President  we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.
We have achieved nothing so far  and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today  and what the Commissioner has announced here  actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words  if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe  which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.
So what are we to do now?
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.
What are we to do now?
I will tell you a few things we should do.
Of course  we need double-hulled vessels.
That goes without saying  but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.
So what do we need to happen immediately?
We need technical testing of ships  that is obligatory technical testing every two years  and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV  an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany  which is compulsory every two years.
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.
This is what we need for ships.
Thirdly  we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports  that is in every port of the European Union.
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port  regardless of all the port charges.
We must reach agreement here  in all the European Union' s ports  from Marseilles  through to Rotterdam  to Wilhelmshaven  Cuxhaven  and wherever ships drop anchor.
Fourthly  we need the shipowner to bear liability  and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million  but to the value of at least USD 400 million  to be covered per insurance certificate.
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.
We need to be sure that if need be  the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.
In the fifth place  we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union  and incidentally  that includes the candidate countries.
Last but not least  we need a long memory  for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.
The unions will have something to say as will industry.
A long memory will serve us well  ladies and gentlemen.
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united  at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned  and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!
Mr President  Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line  a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about  the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.
We must also critically examine the classification societies. I do not think that we can accept their procedures.
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.
Finally  I want to say that  when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment  there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.
Within the Commission  the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment  which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines  cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.
Mr President  we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited  or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations  and indeed many others who  in order to make more profit  take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality  without governments reacting?
The crux of the problem is that all governments  and indeed all the European institutions  acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks  even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.
In these circumstances  even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.
Mr President  I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.
However  we must stick to the facts.
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.
I cannot accept this.
If the Member States decide  in agreement with ourselves  that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control  then they must also make the necessary personnel available.
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing  rather there must be materials testing  for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial  but include materials testing.
Secondly  I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt  we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.
There are reputable companies too.
You will be familiar with some reputable companies  our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies  but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements  and these must be struck off the list.
Finally  we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements  for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!
Mr President  I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force  which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.
It should be noted that the oil industry  through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds  regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol  for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident  or some USD 170 million.
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners  to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.
However  before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations  let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.
Calls for design improvements in hull construction  especially double-hulled vessels  are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.
Mr President  I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues  mainly in the committees on transport and the environment  who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.
Because  as well as the irreparable damage to the environment  the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry  the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry  to the conservation of marine resources  and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.
It is no accident  Commissioner  that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed  those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which  in the majority of cases  do not have any other resources.
These are the same areas  Commissioner  which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts  without any control whatsoever.
I come from a region  Galicia  which has suffered similar accidents in the past.
Brittany and Galicia  two European 'Lands Ends'   fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.
On the one hand  by asking the Commission  within the scope of aid to the fishing industry  to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected  and also by asking them to demand  of international bodies and of themselves  tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.
In this regard  the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.
On the other hand  prevention is essential.
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level  using all the means at our disposal - technological  structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.
Lastly  Mr President  I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities  who reminded me of old times when  as the then Mayoress  I lived through similar situations.
We must thank those who  while defenceless and lacking in resources  have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions  the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.
Mr President  as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy  Transport and Tourism  I should like to congratulate the Commission  and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio  for her reaction to this incident  which has really shaken the whole of Europe.
We  as the Committee on Transport  are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and  of course  we are likewise prepared to discuss  at a later date  the legal implications of this communication.
In addition  I should like to make a number of comments:
First  the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA  the Italian shipping register  because we need to know if Community law was applied.
That should be the starting point for our efforts.
Secondly  apart from the shipowners' liability  it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers  for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and  of course  for restoring the damage.
Once we have done that  our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.
However  this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine  which is an important sector of the economy  covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements  which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict  but correct.
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but  as other members have stressed  we need to start with application  because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.
This legal framework is fairly advanced  at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States  under the supervision of the Commission  should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.
Mr President  Commissioner  I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact  as others have said this afternoon  constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where  since 1967  there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.
The economic and social damage  which we have spoken about today  in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources  is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.
Commissioner  I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.
I trust that these measures will  in a few months  give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive  possibly - which will put an end  once and for all  to these 21st Century pirates  who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken  which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.
I am referring to the double hull  which consists of two layers of steel  with containers divided into two tanks.
Commissioner  there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case  in the event of an accident  the seawater penetrates the containers and  as a result of pressure  the oil is transferred to other tanks.
Commissioner  I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents  is bound to support this approach.
Mr President  Commissioner  I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us  after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings  finally to produce a joint resolution.
I think that given the dramatic circumstances  and as a matter of principle  it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.
On the other hand  Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote  for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.
I think that it is quite obvious  and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster  that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area  common airspace  a common rail area and a single market  but not a common maritime area.
I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation  in which we can set standards.
I have also noted  to my great satisfaction  that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty  or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate  and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.
We sometimes regulate things which could  by and large  remain subsidiary.
In this area we must respond to public opinion.
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are  when all is said and done  on the global scale merely a peninsula.
Therefore  once our legislation has been brought into line  we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law.
We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is  of course  supposed to be a deterrent.
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport  which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.
Mr President  the oil tanker Erika  the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil  foundered off the Breton coastline  with disastrous consequences.
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.
States can carry out port inspections.
In Europe  legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.
However  it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.
In my opinion  the Commissioner is quite right.
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors  esteemed European Commission?
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?
Would it not be beneficial  in the short term  following the Rotterdam model  to inspect according to a points system in which  for example  account is taken of the ship' s age  whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.
In short  to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.
There are four more sister ships in service at present.
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?
Would sanctions not be appropriate  as the Commissioner stated  for the classification society?
RINA is currently the talk of the town.
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.
In my opinion  the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time  and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.
Mr President  just before I went down into the Chamber  I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.
Like many other hundreds of volunteers  she had seen the destruction  washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.
Like so many others  I too wonder where the people responsible are.
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks  whether intentional or unintentional.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently  I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife  in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks  have brought back memories of similar British disasters  such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967  and have prompted many British volunteers to help.
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London  we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.
Ultimately  the polluter must pay.
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.
Moreover  although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice  I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.
Rather than banning flags of convenience  which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet  under the 1995 EU directive on port state control  national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.
I sincerely hope that  particularly during the French presidency later this year  the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options  and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.
Mr President  it feels quite strange to be standing here again today  as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years  and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence  and not by force majeure.
The victims are waiting outside.
They want answers.
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep  or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"
Who will provide us with new jobs?
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group  rather it is a joint European challenge.
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .
But there is an art to that as well.
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.
Valuable experiences were gained  and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.
We are therefore right to demand improved controls  sanctions and preventive measures.
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years  here in Parliament.
The issue is as topical as it was before.
Furthermore  I will not withhold my support but will endeavour  alongside my fellow MEPs  to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.
Mr President  firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks  not only for the initiatives of the different groups  of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats  but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left  who proposed this debate  which has led to a positive and important discussion.
Before the end of March  I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts  that is to say  amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.
I would like to tell you that  in fact  it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem. There are men and women who depend on fishing  gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas.
They are environmentally sensitive areas  but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium. And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.
In fact  I believe that things have been done by the Commission  but there is still more to do.
This was demonstrated by the Americans who  after the Exxon Valdez disaster  within one year  adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation  which threatens  as I said earlier  to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.
In Europe  after the Amoco Cadiz  or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast  in 1976  or the Torrey Canyon  in the same year  or the many other cases there have been  we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995  particularly in the last few years.
During these years  the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.
That is the reality.
In my opinion  we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems  also deriving from American legislation  which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail  if you wish  in an appearance before a special committee on this matter  or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March  also coinciding with the Council of Ministers  and  of course  before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency  for us to have texts to discuss.
Flags of convenience are one problem  but are not the only one.
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but  nevertheless  that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union  and to deal with the notorious problem  which will no doubt arise again  of the aim of a Community register.
I believe that this will be difficult but  in any event  we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.
As for the inspections  very much a key question  the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked  as Mr Hatzidakis has said.
We already have legislation.
According to the information which the Commission services have given me  this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel  means and inspectors.
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected  but rather how we select  how we find  the ships which constitute the highest risk  through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.
Unfortunately  the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.
Therefore  more than making amendments  we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done  apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews  especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships)  two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.
With regard to the question of Union inspectors  I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States  which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.
Lastly  I would like to stress the issue of liability.
Not only in terms of maximum sums insured  which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States  but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and  therefore  the liability of shipowners  and also to hold liable those who charter ships  which is to say the owners of the cargo.
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable  we will never  in my opinion  resolve these problems.
I will end now. I will not expand further.
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.
But  obviously  as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where  within one  two or three years  we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.
As for me  I can say  after having debated it in the College of Commissioners  that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures  amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council  in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.
Thank you very much  Commissioner.
We have taken good note of your intentions.
I have received 8 motions for resolution  in accordance with Rule 37(2)  to close the present Commission statement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
Storms in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
Commissioner  I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward  particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union  in terms of the help that we can offer them.
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.
I think that you must have done so  because you have not mentioned it.
In fact  we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem  but also a medium and long-term one.
Let me explain.
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.
Indeed  for some 'forestry' districts  which have lost 20% of their trees  this represents a huge loss.
We know  for example  that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity  so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one  two or five years  but over many more.
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.
Indeed  you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.
On the other hand  districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer  as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is  and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that  although there has indeed been an economic disaster  the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.
As you yourself said  Commissioner  these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes  and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.
Mr President  everyone who has travelled here by car  train or aeroplane  has been able to see the extent of the damage  particularly in France  caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?
Firstly  I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who  on a daily basis  have had to reassure their constituents  organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.
Next  I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who  in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation  came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey  we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims  but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies  which have been particularly badly hit.
As you said  Commissioner  we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.
Beyond this  I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and  on the contrary  to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments  which they urgently need.
Mr President  the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused  as has been said  90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion  i.e. EUR 11 billion.
Almost three weeks after the disaster  several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones  500 000 hectares of forestry land  or 100 million cubic metres of forest  have been ruined  and our historical heritage has also been affected  as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster  national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.
As the previous speakers have said  and as you said  Commissioner  in response to my fellow Member  Mr Martinez  with regard to another tragedy  the floods in November in the Southwest of France  you have certainly noted these disasters with concern  but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued  which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox  pointed out by the previous speaker  is that it is easier  a great deal easier  to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.
We know full well that what you are doing  Commissioner  and that is  limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.
I can show you a copy if you wish.
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission  but also of this Parliament  and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.
But for pity' s sake  and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way  please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.
As a matter of urgency  therefore  we must restore  within the framework of a supplementary budget  the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That  however  is another problem altogether.
Mr President  Commissioner  Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region  Lorraine  which have suffered enormous destruction.
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities  the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but  unfortunately  their troubles are not yet over.
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter  as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.
The Community action programme for civil protection  established by a Council decision on 9 December  was launched on 1 January 2000.
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.
Our priority  as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up  is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads  and to repair them as quickly as possible.
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest  and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.
Finally  it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood  in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.
This aid for gathering timber is  of course  only the first stage of an aid package  which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile  it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -  but to switch to the precautionary principle  under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.
Current programmes must be accelerated.
For example  as they stand  the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem  it shelves it.
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources  as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject  and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!
Commissioner  Mr President  Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.
However  it has now achieved notoriety.
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims  mainly in France and Germany  but also in Switzerland  leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons  roofs  traffic signs and  ultimately over the forest.
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber  and this is only an estimate.
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner  and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days  then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region  or in a 5b region?
What answer will the Commission give  when it is on the scene  when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building  and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.?
All this is well-intentioned advice.
However  I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid  so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.
Mr President  Commissioner  permit me  first of all  to make reference to two facts.
Firstly  at the beginning of 1999  NATO  with the participation of most Member States of the European Union  flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.
We are now endeavouring  at huge cost  to get the country back on its feet again and help its people  and rightly so.
Secondly  at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.
"We do not have the wherewithal for that " they said.
This is wrong!
And no one can comprehend this attitude.
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity  also from within this Community.
I say they have a right to solidarity.
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.
I call upon you  ladies and gentlemen  to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm  the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.
Then  for example  people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.
When  in 1994  over five years ago that is  I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament  I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission  which will actually enable me to start work.
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste  and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!
Mr President  Commissioner  the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.
Of course  there is a need for solidarity here.
There is certainly a need for European civil protection  and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.
But  most importantly  it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature  for nature cannot make mistakes.
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density  the type of infrastructure  and  of course  the many monocultures  if we are talking forests.
Of course  I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.
But when it comes to aid  we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future  more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation  rather than monocultures.
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.
To this day  we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream  and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.
But in common with others  we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.
This is partly the work of human hand  as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.
We must reduce CO2 emissions  employ renewable energies  and generally make enquiries  in this connection  as to how the forests of Europe are faring.
Mr President  I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.
This is an irreparable loss.
Secondly  we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens  and the solidarity of other countries with France  which is the country worst affected.
As I have little time  Mr President  I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities  in general terms  are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.
In fact  over the last decade  the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.
Secondly  I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.
Furthermore  we should utilise an extraordinary budget line  since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.
First of all  we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.
That is important.
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past. It was very small.
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels  whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.
I think we should reinstate this budget line.
When we had the earthquake in Greece  which was a big disaster  the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.
These are major disasters  we should have an instrument  we do not have it.
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.
Ladies and gentlemen  none of us must forget what has taken place.
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development  forestry would be eligible under Article 33  companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical  active solidarity.
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.
This is inadequate  and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which  moreover  I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for  and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being  if the mandate that our President  Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective  our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force  real civil relief blue helmets  who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union  as we currently have no emergency procedure  but also outside the Union if needs be  in Venezuela or anywhere else  is something that we should hope to see.
I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.
Mr President  Commissioner  when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation  we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.
Nevertheless  the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously  and at the same time  from my position here in this Chamber  point to how important it is to support these regions and people.
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.
For instance  it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae  and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.
The calculations are in decades rather than years.
In addition  I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production  for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President  I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.
We had high winds and unprecedented  prolonged rainfall which  adding to existing difficulties  resulted in thousands of acres being submerged  sometimes  in up to 15 feet of water.
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms  no sanitation  no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.
Natural habitats were destroyed.
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.
Mr President  Commissioner  I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe  and I believe we need  in the long-term  to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests  but maybe we should set up a system  perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector  which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.
Unfortunately  we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.
As has already been mentioned here  there are indications - no proof  but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.
Of course  the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet  but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing  these storms will  of course  hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours  Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women  we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.
However  an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP  for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate  rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm  but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.
Food safety
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.
Mr President  I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety  adopted on Wednesday last  12 January  in association with my colleague  Mr Liikanen.
At my hearing last September  I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge  as well as the BSE crisis.
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions.
This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers  producers and industry generally.
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually  even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.
In saying all of this  I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.
The challenge is to make the system the very best.
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation. All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent  understandable and flexible.
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.
Over 80 measures are envisaged.
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.
It has already attracted much comment  including reactions from Members of Parliament.
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments. We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?
The first key concern is independence.
Key stakeholders  including consumers  are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.
However  the Commission believes that we must go further.
We must create a permanent and truly independent  excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.
However  if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs  this would clearly not be enough.
As the White Paper makes clear  the new authority must be a value-added structure.
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react  identify issues before they become crises.
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function  the coordination of scientific information in the EU  and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission  Parliament and Council.
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be  in my view  a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.
I also reject this line of argument. How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?
In my view  most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based  rationally argued and fully justified.
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.
I can assure you here today that the Commission  in exercising its risk management functions  will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.
This is a major task.
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.
However  with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies  the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level  Community control guidelines  and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission. These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world  boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level  the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation  covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.
The new legal framework will cover animal feed  animal health and welfare  hygiene  contaminants and residues  novel food  additives  flavourings  packaging and irradiation.
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers  farmers and food operators  traceability of feed  food and ingredients  proper risk analysis through  for instance  risk assessment - that is  scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is  regulation and control - risk communication  and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.
As regards the precautionary principle  I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.
However  having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees  I recognise that this was not feasible.
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate. Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views  I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.
It is essential that we get the mix right.
Mr President  I thank the Commissioner for his statement.
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions  including the Commission and Parliament.
That is very much the right approach.
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight. I hope that we can thrash this out.
We need a body of food law  as you have said  and we need to agree this together.
It is very important that we include liability in that process.
That is the one word I am talking about.
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.
That cannot continue.
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem  those responsible are liable.
Mr President  it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.
What is your schedule  how long will it take you to produce a positive list?
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?
That is another point  i.e. the question of obligation  which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.
Thank you  Commissioner  for your statement.
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency  so there is not very much point in your proposing one.
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.
However  as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years  I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system  as you have said  why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?
Secondly  will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States? We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws  given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?
President  first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern  Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.
Once that is done  issues such as liability can be addressed.
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background  but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation  and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.
At the moment the list is  as I say  a negative list and it is added to as required.
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it  2002 in fact.
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.
This is unfortunate and it is wrong  and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing  I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.
I hope that the next time you ask me the question  I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation  although that is part of it  but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.
Commissioner  the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe  and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance  and that on the day that you present your interesting report.
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind  whatever name it goes by  will be given influence over the Council  who in this authority will have the say in matters  and who will issue orders.
Of course  we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content  but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam  and even extending them.
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.
I also welcome the White Paper.
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance  similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?
Mr President  you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery  but you did not mention what that periphery was.
For example  the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather  publish and coordinate data  make recommendations for improved food safety  and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.
In addition to that  the food safety authority will have a board.
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.
But it would have an overall remit  particularly  for instance  in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.
There may be a number of views on that.
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament  through nominees or even MEPs themselves  were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.
It must be visible. It must be known.
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known  who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food  particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition  diet and such issues  so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.
It must be visible.
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for  or advising  the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.
That is an undesirable situation  we do not want that situation in the future.
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists  that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond  where experts are to be found elsewhere.
Over time  as I said a moment ago  not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise  its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence.
It is something that is earned over a period of time.
However  the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission  Parliament and Council.
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but  nonetheless  the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes  consideration has been given to that issue.
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought  particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and  although I come from that part of the world myself  I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean  what problems they have identified  what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.
Equally  the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process  to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and  in those circumstances  as scientists will have to travel  it is probably better that they move to a central location  once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.
That is my judgement at the moment.
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.
Colleagues  I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important  I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner  and his statement.
As you can see  half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000).
We will examine questions to the Commission.
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m.  and you can see the clock.
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.
First Part
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu  while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons  as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu  Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.
According to our information  the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting  construction  commissioning  operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production  including the nuclear option.
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999  the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.
In particular  the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency  the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Thank you for your reply.
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.
At the same time  it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada  which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.
In this sense  there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.
So much for the political aspect.
Now to the technical aspect.
The safety factor in this type of project  and I am speaking as an engineer  has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.
In cases such as this  where there is uncertainty  simulators are used.
However  we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.
In this sense  all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.
Therefore  and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed  it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.
I have explained the position of the Commission.
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.
In the case of Turkey it is different.
The plant is not yet there.
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania  Slovakia and Bulgaria.
Mr President  the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty  it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community  and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.
I do not have these concerns.
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty  but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?
If not  why not?
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
Thank you  Mr Bowe  for your question.
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study.
It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.
However  this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks  if any  are limited to an area around the target.
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe.
A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed. It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.
First of all  Mr President  can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.
This uranium becomes air-borne  is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects  not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?
Thank you  Mr Bowe  for that question.
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.
That is also mentioned in the report.
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report  so they have to take responsibility.
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is  for the time being  the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States  as well as the United Nations and the Commission  something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.
Mr President  Commissioner  in a few months' time  hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer  and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?
I cannot answer that question.
When it comes to medical checks and so on  I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned  that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan  but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.
The Tibet Intergroup  therefore  gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet  calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues  including Tibet  firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues  including Tibet.
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
I urge the Chinese again to do so.
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue  we have focused on a number of practical steps  including sending experts on assignment to Tibet  planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health  education and training for Tibetans.
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.
But for my part  I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys  however worthy the cause.
Mr President  Mr Patten  of course  you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China  and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate  something which has always been blocked hitherto.
However  if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP"   that is  to Mr Solana  then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.
Your approach  which I am very much in favour of  since it is a coherent one  takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.
Imprisonment  torture  the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth  are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this  then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place  but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation  would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission  rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.
As it happens  we deal with the budgetary consequences  the Council makes the appointment.
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.
Putting that on one side  because that is the situation  it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out  among other things  that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice  first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member  who I recognise is interested in these subjects  I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton  the distinguished journalist  on the problems of Tibet.
Mr President  I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting  which betokens peace and happiness.
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned  rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace  serenity  compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness  the Dalai Lama' s  proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.
It is an extremely moving account  not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.
The Commission  like others  has urged dialogue.
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China  the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.
It would be very beneficial  not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia  but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports  the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration  it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made  but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.
Are these reports accurate?
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way  and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September  and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document  a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.
The Commission would like to stress in particular that  in the drafting of the code  it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.
However  it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.
Mr President  I would like to thank the Commissioner.
However  I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force  bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.
The newspaper reports were misleading.
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.
I want to repeat that honourable Members  like the honourable Member who asked the question  who take a particular interest in this issue  will want to have a dialogue about it.
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.
For safety' s sake  I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that  where the Commission and good administration are concerned  there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true!
"I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".
Both documents  that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft  cover largely the same ground.
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography  as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.
As the author is not present  Question No 32 lapses.
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.
According to the Rules of Procedure  you are not required to reply.
I wish you a good evening.
Second Part
Questions to Mr Nielson  who is replaced by Mr Patten
Questions 33 and 34 of Questions to the Commission were intended for Mr Nielson.
Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa.
I must tell you that the Vice-President of the Commission  Mrs Loyola de Palacio  has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that Mr Patten will reply to the questions.
Question No 33 by (H-0829/99):
Subject: 'Mainstreaming' in EU aid policy In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ('mainstreaming') into the full range of EU aid policy.
The guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in 'gender mainstreaming' but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate-General for Development.
'Mainstreaming' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy  strategy and measures.
To achieve that  the Council's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety.
Current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days' training in such issues should form an essential part of the Directorate-General for Development's introductory courses for new staff.
Is the Commission prepared to take such measures?
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague  Mr Nielson  was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is  trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development  part of the so-called induction courses for new staff  something that has been done already but not  I admit  on a regular basis.
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.
As far as possible  we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset  instead of having to be tackled separately and later.
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels. It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies  together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.
In addition  measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals  action plans and strategies.
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.
However  responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.
If the latter do not have the required professional competence  then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development  that is to say unit managers and more senior managers  have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.
Only one manager has participated in gender training  and for half a day.
That is naturally unacceptable.
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees  but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.
This limited training element has  however  been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.
As I point out in my question  one to two days  and not one to two hours  need to be devoted to the subject.
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.
I must not go on about books  but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues  in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies  going back millennia.
Secondly  in my view  while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential.
And  since it should be essential  I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.
Thirdly  one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.
Since 1991  the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors  in particular agriculture  infrastructure development  the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.
In addition to national programmes  the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy  transport and environmental sectors.
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996  following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent  Tajikistan.
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.
Over the same period  Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office  ECHO  has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million  mainly for food  medical supplies  water and sanitation.
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.
Mr President  Commissioner  there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular.
That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence  how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going  that is  with regard to political relations that is.
Of course  that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation  in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures  which are the cause of great aridity.
We were able  at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago  to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.
I can send the honourable Member  if he would like  a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise  had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.
This is not the usual state of affairs.
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.
Thank you very much  Mr Patten  for your interventions today.
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment  Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges  or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies  and  in addition  that there are no exact employment figures.
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment  and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing  recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment  or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned  in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment  the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services  where problems exist  improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed  firstly  to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece  secondly  to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and  thirdly  to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006  which is being financed from the Social Fund  both the resources and the policies should be used  with the Commission' s support  to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.
Thank you  Commissioner for your reply.
However  our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%  we have the second highest unemployment in Europe  which was not previously the case  we have the biggest increase in unemployment  we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed  i.e. less than 1% of GDP  while other countries  such as France  Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%  and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used  inter alia  to combat unemployment.
You tell me that you  as the Commission  have made recommendations.
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.
However  my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?
Did anyone find work?
How many people found work?
If you cannot tell us for this year  then last year and the year before.
What has been done about training?
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?
Do we have any figures?
In other words  do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?
Mr Papayannakis  the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned  and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and  as far as I can see  an increase in productivity.
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.
As you know  there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.
They concern access to training  the ratio of men to women with access to training  and special action for the long-term unemployed.
The Commission will endeavour  for all these specific guidelines  to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?
The Danish pension scheme  the Efterløn  only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are  however  still pending before the Council.
There is  as yet  no European Court case law on Efterløn  but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission  but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.
The Commissioner also more than hinted  of course  that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg  specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions  due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter  for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.
Honourable Member  I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter  to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who  as things stand  have a right to this pension.
Briefly  just to follow on from that last point  I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections  such as they are  would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme  but simply that the Commission has a concern  which it has the right to have under Community law  to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.
I think that the answer is brief and clear.
Of course it is as you say.
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark  that is not where the problem lies.
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection  equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive  for non-consultant hospital doctors  who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors  with the possibility  following negotiation  of increasing it to 54 hours.
The Council  Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.
Parliament has proposed 4 years  the Commission 7 and the Council 13.
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.
Although there is this disagreement  I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).
Which Commissioners are members of this group?
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?
What concrete measures have been discussed?
This question covers several individual matters.
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi  Vice-President Kinnock  Mr Reding and myself.
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women  of which I gave an initial evaluation  the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science  and the third involved Mr Kinnock  who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.
Thank you very much  Commissioner  for your reply  although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet  since this matter is of the greatest importance. We trusted this Commission  from the outset  to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.
I hope that  in the future  things will change and meetings will become frequent  because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude  as quickly as possible  those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.
Mrs Avilés-Perea  that was an exhortation rather than a question.
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least  once it did  important decisions were taken straight away.
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999  the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative  the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.
Under this umbrella  each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States  what will Greece's contribution amount to?
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin  where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.
This is an important aspect of this initiative.
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation.
This is the same as the Social Fund regulation  i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.
The Member States  i.e. the national governments  have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies  submitting proposals  selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.
Within the European Commission  the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation  while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control  the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.
The last question concerns the amount granted.
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million.
The contribution commitment is 80%  rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions  especially the remote Greek islands  and a contribution by Greece of 15%.
Mr President  I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative  especially the four actions described in it  will result both in complicated bureaucracy and  paradoxically  a non-transparent structure.
For example  one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity  as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.
At the same time  the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation  the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures  as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.
However  this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas.
However  at the same time  participation by those actually discriminated against  such as asylum seekers  immigrants and so on  is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.
Finally  if you consider the overall amount  which is on the small side  - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are  I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.
First let me say that it would be a great help to us  now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament  if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.
Secondly  I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment  it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment  or to support an increase in employment.
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund  which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal  especially for countries like Greece.
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission.
To encourage  to assist promotion  to create statistics  to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups  between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for  and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies  non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible  so that it can get as close to the people as possible.
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?
A month ago  the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment  as prescribed in the Treaty  in order to implement Article 13.
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies  Member States and the European Parliament  a number of exceptions have been made.
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.
In a religious school  it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.
For instance  religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.
Surely what we should be doing  and I hope you will agree  Commissioner  is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability  and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice  no matter how sincerely held.
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason  be it the reason which you mentioned  sexual orientation  ethnic discrimination or any other reason.
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.
In other words  it is positive discrimination.
In the example which you mentioned  it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions  and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on  in terms of either finance  entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities  living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line  what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women  or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?
Obviously  the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds  the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.
The aim of these regional policies  which  of course  are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State  i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme  is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006  i.e. EUR 195 billion  will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created  I would like to say  first  that there is  via the Social Fund  an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement  i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.
Secondly  the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism  with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.
Commissioner  thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer  which has been rigorous and well-argued.
However  I can assure you that we do not  with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation  where almost none exists.
Therefore  my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits  which have brought results in cooperation  could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions  who have the odds stacked against them.
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development  we will not promote  as we should  employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.
The Commissioner accepts and takes good note of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s intervention.
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme  setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it  we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament  the social partners and non-governmental organisations.
These discussions have already started  but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society  economic policy and reforms.
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission  after the Lisbon conference  so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.
Clearly  any future social action programme should take account of developments  for example within information technology  and  in time  become a modern social action programme.
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question  namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning  as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.
Firstly  I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.
Social exclusion  the programme for women  the efforts we are making in the social protection area  everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.
Secondly  there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which  as you know  is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.
Since the author is not present  Question No 43 lapses.
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty  it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.
However  for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance  freedom of movement is still highly restricted.
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?
On 26 November 1999  the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned  there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination  especially in the workplace.
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and  in the end  to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.
Of course  it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport  services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses  coaches and other vehicles  so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.
In addition  you should know that  on 4 June 1998  the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs  the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.
It is of course a prerequisite  however  that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities  so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport  so that people with special needs can use them.
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education  for young people  for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark  even though the deadline has passed.
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive  terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.
However  such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark  or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned  given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?
If not  will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.
What it says it that one of two things may apply  i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules  provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that  apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation  the hours in universally applicable collective agreements  concluded by the most representative organisations  also apply to posted workers.
In other words  to put it simply  Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark  and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.
Thank you for a very clear answer  the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.
It is a very clear answer  but it is also an answer  may I point out  which puts Danish organisations  the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very  very difficult situation politically  for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model  which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements  and the Continental model  which presupposes legislation.
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer  Commissioner  concern  first and foremost  another directive  namely the working time directive  but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend  or has expressly stated that it does not wish  to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.
Firstly  no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.
As I said earlier  there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.
As far as your question is concerned  this problem does not only apply to Denmark.
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.
What now needs to be done  and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government  and with other governments  is to find the best way forward  so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States  and which constitutes a general framework  can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.
Thank you very much  Commissioner  for your dedication.
You have fulfilled your objective for today  which is to answer all the questions.
We congratulate you.
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed  Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
1997 discharge
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan  on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control  on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament  II - Council  III - Commission  IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998  SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998  SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]
The Commissioner  Mrs Schreyer  is not here yet  but I hope  and expect  that she will arrive in the next few minutes.
Nevertheless  I recommend that we start  in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate  and particularly the rapporteur' s speech  from her office  if that is where she still is.
Mr President  I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report  it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.
Mr President  early last year  the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.
In its resolution  this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious  far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.
This report  therefore  appears at a crucial time  on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.
In the period leading up to this  it already appeared  on the basis of the initial drafts  that the Commission had made very important pledges.
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation  and this is now in place.
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.
This has now been done.
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.
This is in place too.
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.
It did this as well.
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.
These are sound  first steps which illustrate that  if this Parliament so wishes  changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.
We want more than that  however.
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.
This is not only necessary for proper public administration  it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.
Firstly  Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.
This  however  presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.
In the context of providing information  I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.
If the current draft is correct  then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.
Furthermore  it should be the case that  if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running  the management should be held responsible for it  and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.
Ultimately  we also need to achieve better cooperation  of course  between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.
It should no longer be the case that  although Europe is an economic power  we have no political influence because  when the chips are down  we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it. I would quote Gaza as an example.
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that  as yet  it has been left unused.
Mr President  since 1996  the discharge has acquired a heavy  political significance.
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.
However  we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.
Indeed  the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.
Finally  this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission.
But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.
As long as we have no status  we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union.
The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.
Mr President  the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on  that is  by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them. The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes  particularly in third countries  without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission  in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources. That cannot excuse everything that we came across.
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.
From what I have seen of the reform process  it looks good.
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today  I heard some of what he had to say.
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.
But we need that reform process.
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports  a series of details.
It groups them together and that is very important.
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.
We have to get this right.
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.
We have to remedy that.
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.
We need proper information  given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past. It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and  at the same time  that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.
Mr President  Commissioner  if we are honest  we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.
We are discussing last year' s discharge  but also the Commission' s responsibility.
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.
It is about a Commission which is no more.
There is now a new Commission.
Then it is logical to grant discharge  because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions  but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.
We are all very much anticipating this  but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed. Take  for example  the pledges made by the Commission.
They look good in themselves. I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.
The previous speaker already said something about this.
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level  but at a high level within the Commission - which  instead of enhancing the public nature of documents  is having the opposite effect.
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results. This also applies to whistle-blowers.
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but  at the same time  it is entirely unclear  at this moment when we have to make a decision  what  for example  happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.
This also applies  for example  to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.
In my opinion  the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management  but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general  empty proposals.
At the moment  our group still feels sympathy for  and patience with  the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past  but this patience has a limit.
Clear progress must be visible.
At present  we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals  but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.
Finally  Mr President  the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.
I express the hope that - in fact  I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge  the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned  in this case in the course of 1997.
In our Group  we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.
In that year  we voted against granting discharge. As a result  we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997  too.
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.
So far  the promises which have been made are still  however  to be fulfilled  especially where transparency is concerned.
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution  but against the granting of discharge.
Mr President  first of all  I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.
We support these critical remarks  and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd  against this background  to vote in favour of approving the accounts.
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful  and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we  as Members of this Parliament  were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms  so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.
Again  I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.
We do not think that the new Commission  under any circumstances  could incur liability for the past.
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time  and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.
By means of this extraordinary procedure  Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs  namely with the previous Commission.
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission  and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.
There is no reason why  against this background  we should agree to grant discharge.
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned  we shall abstain from voting  and where  finally  the motion for a resolution is concerned  we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.
Mr President  the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission  to whom it was to be granted  had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work  and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year  1996  was denied.
That is just the way things are  however.
In taking over the mandate  the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.
Since  on account of the college system  discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or  alternatively  denied or postponed  it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged  crop up again as Members of this body.
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge  then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important  to my mind  namely the motion for a resolution.
The comments contained within  under eight headings  are an integral part of the discharge  the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine  as a matter of urgency  whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency  transparency and accountability  and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information  are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.
Mr President  we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.
It is fair to say that the new President  Mr Prodi  and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.
However  the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure  for example  that the enlargement process can succeed.
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate. But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that  as the European Commission is reformed  it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.
Mr President  the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997  but in reality it does not deserve it.
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and  therefore  the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit.
The new Commission has  on the other hand  undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals  and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start.
I do not  however  think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control  and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.
From the outside  it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents.
Otherwise  we cannot carry out our work.
Thank you  Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten  on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control  on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.
Mr President  this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud  nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new  reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform  which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol  tobacco  petrol and consumer goods.
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.
The number of departments has been reduced.
The Commission  in my opinion  has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong  honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.
In order to achieve this  action is required in four areas.
First  financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure  including financial control.
A new independent audit system service must be set up.
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.
In return for this greater degree of autonomy  managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase  this must not be an excuse for inertia.
Urgent change is required today.
Second  the fight against fraud  mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened  firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly  by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.
OLAF  the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts  criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.
A proposal can be made  a proposal should be made  on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty  by the middle of this year.
Third  standards in European public life must be upheld.
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.
A number of codes have since been introduced.
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries  most notably the United Kingdom  and institute a committee for standards in public life  with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers. They must be implemented without delay.
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management  they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.
Crucially  reforms must not be limited to the Commission.
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules  administrative procedures and management practices.
Finally  the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised. It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern  multinational organisation.
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.
Too many young  new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.
Merit must be recognised and rewarded  specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders  or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.
Commissioner Kinnock will  tomorrow  present his communication on reform.
This communication must contain a clear timetable.
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories. Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.
Mr President  I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am  of course  in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate  necessary reforms.
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis  but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points  in order to make people more aware  if possible  of what we are talking about.
All the experts can provide information and news  formulate opinions and give advice  but  they have no political or elective responsibility  and rightly so.
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which  on some occasions  I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone  and no one else  can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case  the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years  and this institution would not move forward  as it should.
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality  discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately  and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.
I would point out that there is no European legal system  but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced  but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and  in any case  the equal need for the right to a defence.
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.
In conclusion  Mr President  Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers  not go into reverse.
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself  are now part of European folklore.
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.
Remember that the Council of Ministers  absent again this evening from our debate  approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months  which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly  it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.
This was  after all  one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.
Have the lessons not been learnt?
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.
We could  in no way  agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.
The less precise  Mr van Hulten  we are in our resolutions  the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.
We have  as the EPP-ED group  submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report  entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee  in particular  our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you  Commissioner  accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct  particularly when considering appointments and promotion.
Looking to the future  we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.
Commissioner  you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.
But  equally  we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.
Mr President  I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.
It is an excellent report.
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.
Yes  a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet  and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.
That is important.
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence  mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.
I will give you one example of this. In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.
It is clear that is not acceptable.
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because  unlike what Mr Elles has just said  the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.
Our own staff policy is outdated. Some of our working practices need radical reform.
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting. We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.
Finally  can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.
The fate of the Commission  of the whole European Union  rests on delivery of this reform.
That is the key issue  delivery of these proposals.
Mr President  I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur  Mr van Hulten  on his first report.
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report  I would like to highlight a few  not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.
Firstly  I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair  which  as it happens  has still not been sorted out.
Curiously  very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets  even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General  and this is clearly something which should not happen.
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections  these documents must be available  and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report.
I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.
It is clear that  over the past couple of years  we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.
Is this possible?
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.
Mr President  I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.
It is his first report here in plenary.
This is worth a compliment although I regret  of course  that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.
In my opinion  this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.
Let us be honest.
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.
We are now four months down the line.
Meanwhile  Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments  more than 100 amendments in the first round.
He went back to work  rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions  but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed  too extensive and too late.
Moreover  I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament  I hope.
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?
Mr van Hulten  my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.
After all  it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.
So tomorrow  if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs  this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.
In any case  it should be clear that my group  of course  fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.
In any event  I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.
I have to inform you  Commissioner  that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group  gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.
I would like to end on the following point.
Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated  we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.
I think that there is a need for this  as public opinion is looking for change and  in any event  my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.
Mr President  this report is positive but  actually  we need more than this.
Fraud  mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere. They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.
Via the structural funds  a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.
After each incident of improper use of this money  and certainly after fraud  the call for stricter control is more pronounced.
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem. It will  at best  lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.
In the next couple of years  we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud  less overheads  more transparency and more democracy.
Mr President  a year has not yet passed  but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.
The first report was widely publicised  formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat  first of the President of the Commission  and then of the majority of the European Commissioners  even though they had no connection with fraud  mismanagement or nepotism.
Reading now what happened then  not even a year ago  it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform  as is maintained today  so much so that this second report - which  on the other hand  could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases  since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament  nor to the majority of the trade unions  who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration  but  in practice  are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members  putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee  thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.
Incomprehensibly  trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition  and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF  thereby placing this institution which should  at least formally  guarantee its impartiality  at great risk.
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time  which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates  discussions and the exchange of information.
Mr President  when it comes to putting its own house in order  the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound  the more applause they receive.
There again  it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen  and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.
Nevertheless  the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see  and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments  it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.
Allow me to start with the most important demand.
We do not want financial control to be abolished.
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made  not in every case  but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here  by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits  for example.
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts  particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.
I do not have exact figures  but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller  to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.
This cannot be ignored or evaded  certainly not on account of soft law  as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.
Irrespective of such legal considerations  it would be an unforgivable mistake  under the circumstances  to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are  at long last  no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.
As we see it  there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller  concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up  and finally  there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF  the new anti-fraud office.
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie  which must be tackled.
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect  especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours  including those of a financial nature.
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned  and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.
Mr President  firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague  Mr van Hulten.
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am  I think  entitled to feel a little proud of him.
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.
Mr President  the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes  an enormous reservoir of money is created  not because it is not desperately needed  not because there are no sound proposals  but because the whole system has collapsed.
A lack of responsibility  too much ex ante  not enough ex post and  as a result  far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind  with all the work organised on that basis.
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March  I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.
Without any doubt  this will then be a service  Mr President  to the European public and  by means of the results we produce  we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.
If  in this way  we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century  we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.
Mr President  first of all  congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.
Mr van Hulten  I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.
There are two points which  in my opinion  deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.
Firstly  there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.
This must be regulated during the IGC.
However  we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have  therefore  submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.
Secondly  as already mentioned by my colleague  Mr Mulder  the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open  democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.
Mr President  I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.
I am sure that it will serve  amongst other things  to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.
At this stage  there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission  demanded by our citizens.
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed  even by its Presidents.
It now appears that this desire is more serious.
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies  it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised  on 14 September  to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway  that he preferred to get things right  but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and  if it is  I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.
We want a strong Commission  which can act in an independent and neutral manner  but with political sense.
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.
Therefore  the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.
I do not know your exact view in this respect  Mr Kinnock  but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively  and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.
Therefore  Commissioner  we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme  and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat  but not with this Parliament  which expects profound and daring changes.
Mr President  the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.
Therefore  the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.
As far as this is concerned  a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis  with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.
Naturally  this is only to be welcomed.
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price  as it were  that is  of having to dispense with independent - and I stress  independent - prior approval.
Up until now  the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.
A single key is to suffice in future.
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks  if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.
If you will pardon me for saying so  Mr Kinnock  what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.
What we really need to focus on  however  is making the checks more effective.
This could be achieved by no longer insisting  in future  that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.
Therefore  in future  prior approval should take place in a targeted manner  that is  only in cases of uncertainty or risk.
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis  that is  in the operational Directorates-General  amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money  so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.
However  the financial controllers must work independently.
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission  when it talks in terms of decentralisation.
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General  but this is precisely what we do not want.
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair  when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings  but these were neither heeded nor passed on.
Therefore  independence is prerequisite for effective checks.
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.
Indeed  the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence  and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.
Mr President  a couple of years ago  the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions  whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.
This was stupid of the old Commission  and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy  I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.
There are too many rights  too many regulations and too little room for leadership.
There is no backbone  and no teeth.
Where is the beef?
And I would also say this to you  Commissioner: please  deliver the beef even if it is British.
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself  but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues  the ones where it hurts!
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.
Stand firm on the demand for mobility  not as a right  as it says here in the report  but as a management tool.
Ensure too  that training becomes a management tool.
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.
Finally  Mr President  as a member of the Bureau until six months ago  I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply  in our own administration  with the demands we are making on others.
We have not done this so far  and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.
Mr President  I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.
This report is about the Commission.
Parliament is a separate subject.
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.
In addition to that  there is the question of duty-free.
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.
Most of the report is about financial control. That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.
After all  it is only 1% of GDP  by comparison with national spending.
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.
We should get it into perspective. It is important to remember that.
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money. They have very little of it.
They have a much wider responsibility. That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment  food safety  foreign trade  the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.
If there is  we have generated it in this House in the past year.
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council  the Commission and Parliament.
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted  doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement  for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.
Mr President  I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.
The process of reform has been going on for some time  and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.
Naturally  there are good  capable employees in the Commission  and they are in the majority.
But we need radical reform.
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.
The Financial Regulation should be amended.
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.
It is just a question of how.
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.
We should be careful about this. We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.
Instead  we should be reforming and decentralising control.
The Commission does not have enough staff.
As Members of the European Parliament  we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.
The staffing system is too rigid.
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees  especially at the top of the hierarchy.
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.
After all  the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.
Mr President  Commissioners  first of all  I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is  on the whole  a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned. Perhaps this is a little worrying.
I hope  like so many others  that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner  only then to have to rush again to put out the next one.
As Mr Blak said  we must instead establish a system with clear roles.
First of all  we need tough regulations  which can be implemented.
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough. There need to be tough rules stating  among other things  what may be decentralised  what may be outsourced and what is independent.
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.
What we need  then  are basic administrative regulations for the EU  for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.
These are what are missing.
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law  but we also need administrative law for the EU.
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt  as binding regulations  the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction  but it is not enough.
Secondly  we must also clarify our own auditing roles.
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations  but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.
Tell me what national parliament  for example  is handed all preliminary investigation documents.
Obstinate as I am  I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise  we shall not get anywhere in this fight.
Mr President  I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch  now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so.
Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement  also with its amendments.
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.
I think that this is also the case here  but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz  who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.
Mr President  one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is  to my mind  the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.
A very important proposal indeed.
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan  because she wants to scrap it altogether.
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.
On the one hand  we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but  at the same time  Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well  as a result of which  in fact  the entire content of this report vanishes.
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock  but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.
In my opinion  such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.
Finally  the issue of officials.
Actually  I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.
I do agree that the section on officials has  in fact  been completed totally inadequately.
First of all  the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised.
Secondly  all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted  and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.
For example  we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but  at the same time  we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other  and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.
Mr President  ever since Plato' s 'Republic'   the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine  themselves  what its future should be.
In this second report  the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament  which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office  since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members. The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.
According to the experts  Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life  and this should be a standing committee  not elected  presumably made up of another group of experts.
In this  their second report  the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund  that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.
Unfortunately  it was then changed  and changed for the worse  which turned it into a document which in fact  proposes something that we cannot accept.
Mr President  Mr van Hulten  your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising  arduous and complex  and I believe this is important in a first report.
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate  and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.
This report seems to me to be redundant  long-winded  confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet  and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.
That is to say  if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said  but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem  where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on  ad infinitum.
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission  we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.
Meanwhile  we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.
'Long-winded' .
I am not going to mention the length of this report.
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here  but  for this type of resolution it certainly does.
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.
It is also 'confusing' .
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue  but not in this report.
And finally  Mr President  frankly  I am not going to give examples  but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.
Therefore - in summary - I await  and many of us await  your report  Commissioner Kinnock  so that we can really express our opinion on it  which is the duty of this Parliament.
Mr President  the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though  it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.
Securing this is a major priority.
The importance of smooth-running  comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.
This is not just about bureaucratic reform  however; rather  it is about showing good will towards the citizens.
We must win back their faith in EU politics.
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.
This is what enables them to understand what is going on. They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends  to a very large extent  on the Commission' s own initiative.
However  it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.
However  Mr Kinnock  your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather  as Parliamentarians  we want  and must  play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week  before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.
I believe  Mr Kinnock  that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level  the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House  there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full  formally and in detail for everything I have done.
Mr President  may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and  from what I hear  the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects  certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance  as several Members have said  to all of our Institutions.
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.
Mr President  as you will know  Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and  since I want to make a comprehensive reply  particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control  I seek your indulgence.
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September  I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today  well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing  it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.
Hence the transmission.
Though time forbids me  Mr President  from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House  I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.
The need for transparency is rightly stressed  not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable  not just to this House  but more generally to the European public.
Naturally  sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information  but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.
I have repeatedly emphasised that  indeed not just as a Commissioner  but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.
As the House knows and has repeatedly said  the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.
We share the view  forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts  and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.
Change in the law is fundamental.
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy  but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.
In addition  and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system  the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said  established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.
That service will open on 1 May this year.
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague  Mrs Schreyer  who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.
As Budgets Commissioner  here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.
The proposed change will make the systems more effective  both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.
In addition  I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month.
"The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.
For instance  the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.
At the same time  the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies  notably the same Financial Controller  the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but  over the years  it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.
Our objective  the committee' s objective  the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control  it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud  corruption  mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions  we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.
Since June of last year  the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.
We are seeking to implement best practice.
Serious response to reports  confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.
As a corollary  there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.
A communication later this year will give full details.
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose. I am persuaded  however  by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness  fairness  consistency and professionalism.
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.
That is in line with the draft resolution.
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.
I welcome Parliament's support for that.
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents  made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment  training  appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.
Members  who  in the course of this debate  have properly praised Commission officials  who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity  hard-working and of great capability  are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points  detail and precision are obviously essential.
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months. Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.
It is  meanwhile  very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament  as an institution  on central matters of common interest  notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay  conditions  staff representation rights and so on  but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.
That is most certainly relevant.
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.
It is very clear  however  that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.
Parliament has frequently made that point.
Secondly  it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.
Thirdly  it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.
They are already having implications for resource availability.
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.
I want to emphasise  however  that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission  it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.
I conclude  Mr President  by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur  to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then  most important of all  working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Middle East peace process (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights  as he arrived hot-foot from the region.
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East  even though  as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.
Such is life.
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would  in all normal circumstances  wish to do.
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.
It is not something  I assure you  which I would wish to make a practice of.
Like honourable Members  I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations  despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future.
I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.
A fair and  indeed  generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
Although there has been some slippage  I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.
Similarly  despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline  I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat  when they met on Monday.
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible  in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process  as all sides - Palestinians  Israelis  their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan  Lebanon  Syria and Egypt.
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.
In this context  let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them  helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon  the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict  will also demand considerable efforts.
We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world  numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.
Lastly  but maybe most importantly  we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas  bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.
I want to underline that point.
I wish insistently to remind the Council and  should it be necessary  Parliament  that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide.
I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.
We have made progress in recent months and weeks  as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.
Lastly  I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes  what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate  largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.
I hope the House will understand that.
Mr President  Commissioner Patten has our understanding.
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and  therefore  I hope to see him there soon.
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region  accompanied by other Council representatives.
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.
In this sense  I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude.
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.
It is also true  however  that  since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements  39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority  together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and  more importantly  this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with  since  under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh  the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks  as Prime Minister Barak has promised.
On the other hand  the decision to delay the second round of talks  initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic  is undoubtedly significant  but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.
Mr President  the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution  in this ever controversial debate  which is the result of a broad consensus  seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.
I would therefore like  equally firmly  to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences  which are still no doubt profound  between the parties.
In my judgement  this constitutes a guarantee to both sides  both from a political and a financial point of view  of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.
But this also serves to make a claim  on the part of the European Union  for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.
Mr President  I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here. We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.
Es ist natürlich ein Friedensprozeß, der schließlich im Gange ist.
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago  the difference between then and now is like that between night and day  despite difficulties and delays.
I want to emphasise four points. First of all  the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains  as everyone knows  a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments.
This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements. While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun  I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza  the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank  further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.
The second point relates to Syria. There  the border question is obviously central.
How negotiations are proceeding there  we still do not know.
What is important  however  is that they have begun.
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.
As things are at present  the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply.
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.
According to UNIFIL  there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw  which is something we welcome.
There too  of course  outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year  with or without Israel' s support.
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year  there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.
In this context  it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said  namely a state subject to public control  and that it should be a democratic state.
This is something to which we all want to contribute.
Mr President  I would like to refer  firstly and above all  to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate.
My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and  needless to say  approves of it. More specifically  however  I would like to express our delight at the fact that  after such a long time  Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.
It is  therefore  regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.
Indeed  both parties will need to make huge efforts.
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders  as well as Syria' s integrity.
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria  I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that  in the framework of economic and regional cooperation  a multilateral approach will appear possible.
Nevertheless  it is still regrettable that the European Union  one of the most important financial donors  is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.
This is where Mr Solana  the High Representative to the Council  could come into his own.
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.
In this respect  we support Libya' s participation  provided that it recognises human rights  renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.
There are still  needless to say  many unresolved problems and unanswered questions  also involving the Palestinians.
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that  with the necessary trust  perseverance and indispensable political will  our common goal  namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East  will be achieved.
Mr President  it is pleasing that  despite certain delays and problems  the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.
The moment of truth is approaching.
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and  in exchange for peace and security  hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and  therefore  reliable as a partner in peace?
Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country  Israel  does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all  however.
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.
Against this background  I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held  which is obviously a welcome initiative.
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world  not one of them  however  is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism  which of course is completely incorrect.
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as  for example  Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.
But today  Egypt  Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.
Mr President  I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political  social and economic rights in every country in this region  and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria  Palestine  Israel and everywhere else.
This is an exercise in sovereignty  and in democracy for each population and every individual  but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights  and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question  but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.
Israel has to accept its responsibilities  withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but  at the same time  it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.
However  Israel is not the only country concerned with security.
The same goes for the other countries  especially for the Palestinians  who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C  despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements.
Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999  174 000 dunams of land were confiscated  8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government.
Trees have been uprooted  houses are still being demolished and  above all  water supplies have been reduced or refused  especially in East Jerusalem  while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.
Nevertheless  there is no doubt that with the election of the new government  positive steps have been taken: negotiations  at least  have resumed.
But in the Middle East  there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state  if they cannot move freely within their own territory.
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332  248  245 and 194.
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria  as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States  as Minister Gama said.
Mr President  firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today  particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process  and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.
Nevertheless  we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel  the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.
On the issue of Palestine  I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment  as well as the transfer of territories.
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted  as well as not approving new ones  pose further obstacles.
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations  although  I believe  these talks will not be held up indefinitely.
At present  the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first  while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.
Currently  both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.
In conclusion  while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process  now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process  Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.
I sincerely hope that  in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East  all the key protagonists will move forward quickly  in the very near future  so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.
Mr President  the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria  but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.
Indeed  the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories  at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine  whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question  which no one discusses anymore  thereby relegating the problems of millions of women  elderly people and children  the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked  to oblivion.
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality  but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold  colourless  artificial neon bulbs in our lamps  which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.
Mr President  the Israeli author  Amos Oz  managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that  in exchange for the Golan Heights  all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.
Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude  even physical absence  of the strong man of Damascus  President Assad  at the negotiations in the United States.
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?
Well  the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.
At the end of the day  Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.
It is  however  very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron  the United States  not to mention the heavy  equally costly  security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question. How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?
Mr President  the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news  but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.
It is clear that  for once  the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations  and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967  while the Israelis wish  since they consider that it suits their situation better  to have the borders which were set in 1923.
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority  the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February  the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?
Unfortunately  very little.
It naturally has to support these negotiations  sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy  Ambassador Moratinos  who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency  within the powers of the European Union  is positive.
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence  because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend  we will have to remember that  for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region  60 are contributed by the European Union.
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow  it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role  that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region  as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations  will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.
Mr President  Mr President-in-Office of the Council  Commissioner Patten  I should like to thank you for your statements  especially Commissioner Patten  whose analysis I fully share and I shall not  therefore  repeat any of his ideas.
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which  for various reasons  a Member can formulate more openly.
First  I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo  Wye Plantation  Sharm el-Sheikh.
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.
However  in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week  namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.
I consider this to be very encouraging news.
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria  the problem in this region will be solved.
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.
In Germany  there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.
That would be a similar situation.
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there  Commissioner Patten.
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament  and that includes your proposal  and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action  the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.
Mr President  Commissioner Patten  the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point  which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope  as Mr Patten said just now  that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.
All the foreign troops  including therefore the Syrian forces  must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000  the date promised by Ehud Barak?
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?
We really hope and believe so.
Never have the parties been so determined.
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday  we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.
In terms of balance  or should I say imbalance  I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.
At midday  Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.
Despite everything  we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.
Like other Arab countries before them  the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image  and this is a fact  not a judgement.
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten  Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process  it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99)  on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights  Justice and Home Affairs  on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom  security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).
Mr President  1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam  of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.
These have been the most important moments in the Council' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom  security and justice in the European Union.
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty  combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia  and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence  as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner  Mr Antonio Vitorino  and we congratulate them on this as well.
Furthermore  they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level  but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions  despite the fact that  for this House  the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying  for five years  our role  our ability to participate actively  to democratically control this area of freedom  security and justice  as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.
However  if  on verifying the progress made during 1999  which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty  we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out  the scene looks considerably darker  Mr President.
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to  the other begrudges.
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level  the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or  at least  this Parliament is unable to do so.
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House  for example  about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.
Schengen has been incorporated  as we said earlier  into the acquis  but it has been done with very little transparency.
Not a single piece of information  nor a single consultation  has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom  nor on the incorporation of Greece  nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports  but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action  in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions  or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.
If it chooses the second approach  it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom  security and justice is built.
Alternatively  it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions  in order to move forward in another way.
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit  thus preparing for the future.
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States  and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer  more just and more secure.
Madam President  Commissioner  ladies and gentlemen  it is rather moving for me to return to this House in my capacity as a Member of the Council.
I was one of the first Portuguese Members of this House who  in 1986  took the first steps towards the integration of Portugal into the European Union  and I have to say  Mr President-in-Office of the Council  ladies and gentlemen  that the experience I gained here  political experience  has been extremely important in my life  and that the information we gained and the contribution that we were all able to make towards building Europe definitely marked the years that I spent here  and indeed my life.
So it is with some pride and satisfaction that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those days who are still in this House.
The point I wish to make is that the Portuguese Presidency - to which the Minister for Justice  who is handling the field of justice and home affairs  and I myself both belong - wishes to usher in a new era with this Parliament  and to foster the relationship between the Council and Parliament. This will inevitably be influenced by my parliamentary experience in this House  and of course by the parliamentary experience of that great Member of our national Parliament who is now the Minister for Justice and my colleague.
We gave an early signal when  before the start of the Portuguese Presidency  we met with the President and Vice-Presidents of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights  Justice and Home Affairs in Brussels.
We were able to invite the Chairman of that committee  Mr Watson  and some members of the committee to come to Lisbon  and to present our views concerning the role of the Portuguese Presidency in this area to them.
And we gave an undertaking then that I now want to repeat formally: during all meetings of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights  Justice and Home Affairs  a representative of the Council  at political level  not an official but a political representative of the Council  from one of our 'cabinets'   will always be involved in the work of the committee ...
(Applause)
and whenever the committee thinks fit  and the Chairman requests it  I myself or my colleague  the Minister for Justice  will come to Brussels to take part in the work of the meeting.
We will accordingly give the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights  Justice and Home Affairs the provisional agendas for the Council meetings in March and May  to allow contact to be established beforehand on the subjects to be discussed in the Council. We will do this today.
Turning to 1999  we find ourselves in the special position of taking stock of the German and Finnish Presidencies. I would like to start by saying that  in addition to the replies that we shall be giving here to Mrs Terrón i Cusí  who has presented a proposal on behalf of her committee  we shall also be letting her have a written reply at the end of these discussions.
Furthermore  I would like to say that the Council believes that 1999 was an important year in the field of justice and home affairs.
Cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs was notable for the significant changes wrought by the Treaty of Amsterdam and  as a consequence  for the incorporation of Schengen into the Community framework.
The German Presidency had an important task in this respect in achieving the transition from the Maastricht system to the Amsterdam system.
Then there was the launching of Europol soon after the start of the Finnish Presidency  on 1 July 1999.
There was also a third notable event: the Tampere Summit  a European Council devoted exclusively to justice and home affairs.
The Tampere Summit was marked by a new spirit and by a determination to put the area of freedom  security and justice at the top of the political agenda and to keep it there.
The point that the Portuguese Presidency wishes to reiterate here is that we intend to keep issues connected with the area of freedom  security and justice at the top of the presidency' s political agenda.
As regards our replies to Mrs Terrón i Cusí  I shall try to respond to her questions on home affairs  and my colleague will then address the points relating to justice.
As you know  the Schengen acquis applies in full to ten countries  and in the course of 2000  work will be done with a view to reaching a decision on the acquis coming into force in Denmark  Finland and Sweden  and also in Iceland and Norway.
The Secretary-General of the Council has published a collection of documents covering the entire Schengen acquis  pending publication in the Official Journal once all the translations are available.
This collection is  at present  available in six languages and the remaining translations are nearing completion.
Another issue I wish to raise concerns programmes in the field of immigration and asylum and how they apply to the CEECs.
In March 1998  the Council adopted the Odysseus programme  a programme of training  exchanges and cooperation in the fields of policy on asylum  immigration and crossing of external borders.
It applies to the fifteen Member States of the Union and provides for applicant countries  and possibly third countries also  to be associated with it.
This programme covers the period 1998 to 2002  and the reference amount for its implementation is EUR 12 million.
Applicant countries can be associated with projects selected by the management committee as long as this complies with the objectives of the programme.
The financial envelope envisaged for 2000 is EUR 3 million.
Under the 1999 programme  the Commission received 80 applications for finance  totalling EUR 7.5 million  against a budget for 1999 of EUR 3 million.
The Commission proposed support for 35 projects  of which 12 were for EUR 50 000 and 23 for amounts over EUR 50 000.
With regard to the OISIN programme  and I am now referring to the 1997 budget year  projects were adopted for seminars  training  exchanges of officials  research and studies  and operational actions.
Of 62 projects in all  seven included applicant countries.
As regards SIS  the Schengen Information System  I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its operation and use.
The increase in the number of positive results demonstrates the efficiency of the system and there is a continuing increase in the number of reports.
With a view to developing a customs information system  agreement was reached with the Commission on a system which will permit provisional application of the Convention on the Customs Information System as soon as a certain number of countries have ratified this convention.
Mrs Terrón i Cusí also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement.
I ought to comment on this final point once my colleague  the Minister for Justice  has spoken  but it is obvious that what I shall say is the result of an exchange of impressions within the Council  and in particular between the two of us.
I referred earlier to a new relationship with the Commission and with Parliament  with a view to achieving closer links and providing Parliament with timely information on subjects to be discussed by the Council. I would now like to state before you here that we firmly intend to consult the European Parliament  not only in those cases stipulated by the Treaty  which we are obliged to do  but also to inform and consult Parliament whenever we believe that it is appropriate to widen this type of consultation  and when  in direct contact with the Commission  we believe that Parliament should be able to present its opinion.
As regards information  we will communicate with Parliament on all matters which are important for establishing the area of freedom  security and justice. This partnership between the Council and Parliament  building on the Commission' s role and the excellent work Commissioner Vitorino has always done  will make it possible for the Portuguese Presidency to represent a landmark in establishing this area of freedom  security and justice.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President  Commissioner  ladies and gentlemen  as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament  you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech  1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam  an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council  and a fundamental expectation  as from this year  that will be realised in the form of specific actions.
We are all aware that  to this end  it is essential for the Council to approve  as quickly as possible  the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing. I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us  I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime  the operation of the Judicial Network  particularly as regards criminal matters  and questions on Europol.
Regarding the fight against organised crime  1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan  which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations  in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering.
And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work  not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium  but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists  particularly at Council level  on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency  with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.
If this is not to be a mere media event  it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee  the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.
Here  in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact  it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation  a plan which is now being finalised  and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States  in Moscow  and to develop a set of further initiatives.
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols  and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe  in particular on cyber crime.
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme  the presidency believes that it is worthwhile  bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty  to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.
With regard to the Judicial Network  significant progress has been made  in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network  whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.
However  we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium  so as to give a fresh impetus  while preserving continuity  to the work done under the previous action plan.
Still on judicial cooperation  considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro  and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible  we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments  and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects  including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions  and we believe that on the basis of work already done  it will be possible  at least in the field of seizure of assets  for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.
Lastly then  Europol  which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments  with which Parliament is familiar  to make Europol' s operations viable but  of course  the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain  and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol' s powers and  above all  to give it an operational dimension.
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network  since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust  this option cannot be ruled out at present.
For this reason  it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel  so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.
I believe that in this context  and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust  it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.
We are familiar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council' s legal advisers.
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol  and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.
Mr President  Members of the Council  ladies and gentlemen  first of all  without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions  I have to say that I am not moved  rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time  and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom  security and justice  and to thank all the Members who  in their various committees  have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.
In this first speech  I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important events in 1999.
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom  security and justice.
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom  security and justice.
At the same time  it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms  and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union  in the wake of the establishment of the internal market  the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union  recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base  with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access  on equal terms  and in which our citizens can have real confidence.
The Union' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom  security and justice was confirmed at Tampere.
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council  reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project  together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality  following a progressive strategy  within a time-frame of five years  and that  above all  the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom  security and justice.
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development  it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter  so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.
As I have already said on a number of occasions  I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect  on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process  the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law  rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission  I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe' s common heritage.
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen  an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms  with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection  in other words  a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament  that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and  as a consequence  the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.
In addition to these events  I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.
In the field of immigration  borders and asylum  the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database  and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families  as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration  and ultimately  in December  it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.
In the field of judicial cooperation  the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I)  the convention on jurisdiction  recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II)  and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.
In 1999  we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union  which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime  in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation  including the cost of justice.
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime  the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering.
In 1999  Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission  echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today  sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam  there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions  and in particular Eurojust.
In 1999  the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs  which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.
This list of actions  which is not exhaustive  should  here today  in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House  help to make it clear that  while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area  it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase  marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom  security and justice.
For this reason  2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement  with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.
In other words  2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council  for Parliament and for the Commission.
As I have already said  the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam  in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning.
It will also  and above all  be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public. It is for the public  therefore  that we are developing the area of freedom  security and justice.
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council  nor even to the European Parliament  but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves  in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.
In the coming weeks  I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.
And we hope  during the Portuguese Presidency  to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council  taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions  and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.
For this reason  and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing  I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship  for legality and  ultimately  for democracy itself.
In addition to the scoreboard  I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom  security and justice as a priority in its work programme.
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation  which is also the political message of Tampere  and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.
Regarding immigration and asylum  the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis  in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration  and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.
Furthermore  on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States  which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons  I shall  in the next few days  be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.
Turning to judicial cooperation  in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations  I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims  alimony claims and non-contested claims.
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions  the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.
We will be organising and supporting actions including  in particular  the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention  so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area  and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.
The Commission will also support the presidency' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering  an eminently cross-pillar issue.
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions  criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings  economic exploitation of immigrants  and sexual exploitation of woman and children  with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication  notably the Internet  for distributing child pornography.
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.
In this field the Commission  in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament  will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.
With regard to Schengen  without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council  or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework  I would like to stress  on the topical subject of restoring border controls  that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.
As was emphasised at Tampere  and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000  we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies  which strengthen the links between the Union' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union' s position on the world stage.
Nevertheless  I must make it clear that all these actions will  of course  have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries  so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom  security and justice.
Furthermore  it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.
Lastly  I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself.
As I have told Parliament  the task before us is immense and ambitious
Mr President  having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market  the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom  security and justice  a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other' s competence.
Commissioner Vitorino  although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable  words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.
It looked  as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee  as if the Council understood the area of freedom  security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein  security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.
Minister Gomes  I have  of course  heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.
I should like to raise three points which for us  as Members of the PPE Group  must be focal points when such an area is created.
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.
As far as a European asylum law is concerned  a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.
Unfortunately  however  it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.
Similarly  it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime  including by Europol and Eurojust.
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.
However  the Council should also bear in mind that  if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime  we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit  as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.
We are not just calling for more control  and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments  we may have a great deal of control  but it is inefficient control.
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament  without hampering the work of Europol.
At the same time  we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context.
If the establishment of such an area  in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens  is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats  while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake  then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and  as we have already said  to strengthen the principle of democratic control.
We want an area of freedom  security and justice for the citizens of Europe  not against them.
Mr President  I have nothing further to say to the Council.
The previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all!
Why does the Council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom  security and justice?
I find this question more and more worrying.
Allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view.
The establishment of an area of freedom  security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty.
The police and judicial policy are quite clearly elements of sovereignty  in other words sensitive political areas in the Member States  and shifting the interface of these and communitising these policies  i.e. delegating powers from the national capitals  from Lisbon  Berlin or Paris  to Brussels represents a transfer of power.
Of course it is very  very difficult to break away from the executive forms which have been handed down to us  even if we recognise that police cooperation is necessary; we can only fight international crime at European level.
So we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instruments available.
As a result  the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need  also realise that  in implementing this  they are taking away their own powers.
Then there is the European Parliament  which is also complicated.
In the final analysis  however  we must find a way forward  because if we carry on as we have in the past  and with last year' s experience  then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens' rights will be marginalised in the national parliaments as a result of making it a half national  half European structure.
It has not quite taken off in the European Parliament and the Council meets behind closed doors.
If the establishment of an area of freedom  security and justice is kept secret  then we shall not win the citizens over to it.
In other words  the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it.
This is why I frequently get so worked up  but not over the Council of Ministers.
Generally  they too are elected Members of Parliament: Mr Gomes  Mr Costa  Commissioner Vitorino  in principle we are all in the same boat.
However  I should like to make an appeal to the Council apparatchiks.
The following principle applies: He who prepares decisions  in this case the Council apparatchiks  anticipates the decisions  which is why the Council apparatchiks should demonstrate more democratic spirit.
I should just like to mention another aspect briefly because I do not have much time.
Scoreboard sounds like skateboard in German.
I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented  when and by whom.
This Vitorino plan is what we need: clear  precise projects with a clear  defined timetable.
Mr Vitorino  whom I would like to thank for his speech  can give us that  provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources.
Let us give him those resources  then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain.
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.
The first is asylum.
It is essential to establish a single European system  but one based on fairness  full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions  including an end to routine detention.
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom  not just about repression.
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty  the end of the nation-state  and so on.
But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France  including British student  Isabel Peake  who was thrown off a train  shows why we need mutual recognition.
Arrested and released in Madrid  he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.
Whatever the Eurosceptics say  it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.
Finally  as has already been said  it is essential  and I hope that the IGC will cover this  to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas  with democratic and judicial scrutiny.
Mr President  all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.
I hope that it works out.
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe  and for the area of freedom  security and justice in particular.
Numerous questions are still outstanding.
Answers are still awaited.
Since Tampere  there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.
On the other hand  quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future.
However  it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.
In Tampere  the question of granting operational powers was discussed.
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.
Parliament has amended the contractual text.
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi.
Unfortunately  no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.
Europe as an area of freedom  security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers  I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.
Mr President  Commissioner  the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed  six months after the election of this new Parliament  we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom  security and justice  particularly social justice.
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity  we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism  xenophobia  nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.
Last week  and somewhat by chance  I witnessed  at Roissy airport  a scene of rare violence in which two young women  admittedly illegal immigrants  were being returned to Conakry.
They were treated like the worst criminals.
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair  surrounded by a horde of state security police.
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.
Our role should be to accompany  reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund  we could take the decision to set this up.
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere  even though this summit provided an important basis.
Likewise  we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.
The laws against racism must be harmonised.
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia  racism and sexism?
We must take the best from each of our countries.
When six European countries have granted the right to vote  the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote  and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections  to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries  including your own  must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords  an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation  rendering them modern-day slaves.
In more general terms  this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.
How do you intend to make our people understand that  today like always  immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is  and will remain  essential in the context of population?
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?
Mr President  there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security  freedom and justice.
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.
Ireland  for generations  sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world  but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations  we are showing a very ugly side to our character.
Racism in Ireland is endemic.
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.
There is a willingness but fear pervades  and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.
Mr President  we take note that the excuse-making  reticent Presidency  which  in recent months  has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today  has come to an end.
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz' s remarks  and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom  security and justice  without having to derogate from their own powers.
Nevertheless  to avoid the customary circus  which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council  maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are  of course  underpinned by a mantra of the kind which  in recent years  has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding  but pernicious.
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom  Security and Justice.
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House  namely to introduce such an area.
And who is not in favour of security  freedom and justice?
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.
Freedom  security and justice are the root system of any society  reflecting its history  corporate experience and political development.
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society' s sustaining damage as a result.
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security  freedom and justice.
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law  policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.
It is concerned with increased integration which  as part of a duplicitous package  involves increased repression and control.
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa  Schengen  Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.
First of all  the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.
How is it envisaged that the EU' s institutions  which are already stretched well beyond their capacity  can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?
Think of last year' s deadly criticism of the Commission' s lack of propriety  ethics and accountability.
It also  of course  finds indirect expression in the question.
But  secondly  the projects will put a strain on  indeed will be injurious to  the national democracies.
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market  only the body was being attacked.
Now  it is the soul.
Mr President  today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom  security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon  which has been accepted  will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons  nor have the loyalist terrorists  yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.
In 1998  we had 55 murders.
In 1999  we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.
Between 1998 and 1999  loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people  while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193  while those against republicans totalled 97.
Since January 2000  there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans  loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults  one leading to another murder  while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.
Mr President  that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.
Mr President  the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.
This is a task which all MEPs  the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation  as has been said already  of an area of freedom  security and justice.
The Tampere Council  the motor and architect of this objective  has proposed certain goals  but five years  the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty  is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed  especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens  as the Commissioner has explained very well.
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system  adopting common procedural rules and  above all  putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country  Spain  and in Belgium  are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area  but we must do so with rigour  with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions  which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.
Finally  in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights  the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.
The Euro  employment  even security  are not enough.
They need a 'European soul'   as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.
Mr President  unlike some of the previous speakers  I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.
This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom  security and justice in the European Union.
One area though is extremely important  and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised  that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.
And we must make certain that the details are applicable  appropriate and relevant to the different countries.
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon  one or two of which were referred to earlier on.
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system  for example.
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this  but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.
Mr President  I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry  Mr Costa  and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together  as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.
I would like to make three brief points.
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up  we have had a few minor spats  but we need to work effectively together.
Let us stop the shadow-boxing.
Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.
We have established a new Directorate-General  yet it has only 70 people all told.
There is an agreement to double this number  but I understand that  so far  not a single new person has arrived.
We are setting the Commission a massive task  not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.
Finally  on the content of the debate  I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom  security and justice at the top of its agenda.
All good things come in threes  especially in our policy area.
Two hundred years ago it was liberty  equality and fraternity  and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.
Now it is freedom  security and justice  and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security  important as it is  above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom  security and justice should be mentioned  we must remember that there is still room for progress.
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic  including all people  whatever their nationality  or excluding some.
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future  these plans do nothing to improve human rights  civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements. Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back].
Furthermore  it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.
However  the main concern remains ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President  I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.
I thank them for their statements to the House.
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.
We already have  on the international side  plans in place to combat drug trafficking  money laundering and so on.
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs  and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly  to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly  to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.
Mr President  I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out  or remind  the representative of the Commission that  in Belgium  the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence  right to be reunited with their families  etc.
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me  within the foreseeable future  of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State  in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.
Mr President  esteemed gentlemen from Portugal  especially the Council representatives  you face great expectations on our part.
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.
I refer to Eurodac.
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system  as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications  in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and  above all  in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument  together with an implementation committee  which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.
Even in Tampere  we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.
However  the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected  i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation  that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that  where possible  Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed  you will be doing us a great service.
Mr President  Ministers  Commissioner  the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich  so much so that it became difficult to gather  i.e. to put those decisions into practice.
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.
However  the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions  such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam  the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar  and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions  priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom  security and justice.
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made  we  the European Parliament  would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas  as well as its lack of common vision and  in particular  the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.
From what I have said  it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example  how much progress are you willing to make and what measures  legislative or otherwise  will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings  child pornography on the Internet  drugs  and organised crime?
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community  reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN  is it not about time you abandoned your traditional  conservative views on refugees and immigrants?
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.
Mr President  I welcome much  indeed most  of what has been said in this debate.
But I want to add a word of caution.
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community  but too many: national  European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there  there is the Court in Luxembourg.
There are also courts in Karlsruhe  London  Lisbon  Dublin and Edinburgh.
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights  for that would be the enemy of freedom  justice and security.
We need  in short  to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.
But we must look always to subsidiarity.
Like everybody in this House  I want freedom  justice and security.
I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation  chaos and confusion.
Madam President  ladies and gentlemen  I would very quickly like to make one point.
Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal  and my colleague  the Minister for Justice  and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you  Minister.
The debate is closed.
Mr President  I am grateful for the Council' s oral  and also written  reply.
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms  Justice and Home Affairs. Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.
Personally  I am pleased with some of the replies  for example  in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention  which we hope will be reviewed  and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.
Representatives of the Council  within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.
I am sure that  with the willingness that you have shown today  the first thing you will do  in this new climate of understanding between us  will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000).
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu  while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons  as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?
Mr President  the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety  the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.
The aim of this convention  which came into force on 24 October 1996  is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation. It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks  so as to protect individuals  society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.
The convention  as you will be aware  also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.
I would also like to remind Members that  as a candidate for membership of the European Union  Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition  which is an important point - sooner or later  as part of its own pre-accession strategy  have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time  and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.
Thank you for your answer.
However  I would just like to add the following. Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.
Nevertheless  rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.
In this respect  the issue requires closer examination  because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions.
My second point concerns the safety of these plants. In areas of high seismic risk  it is not enough just to have secure  earthquake-proof buildings.
Speaking as an engineer  I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.
However  we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.
With this in mind  it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.
In this respect  and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union  we should be helping it to become a more secure  peaceful and cooperative country.
That is our role and this is the point of my question.
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.
This is  of course  a highly sensitive issue.
Furthermore  it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey  in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them  particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns  and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.
Thank you  Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.
However  forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.
Will you please therefore undertake  before the next plenary in February  to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public  immediately the Council has passed legislation  rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?
Mr Newton Dunn  I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question  and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.
With regard to what you were saying  it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council  apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note  does not actually refer to the opacity  shall we say  of the legislative process  but rather almost to an excess of transparency.
However  I would like to say  Mr Newton Dunn  that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.
We have no problem  Mr Newton Dunn  in repeating this information to you in writing  but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here  because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council' s functions as a legislative body.
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled.
Instead  my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?
I should like to have an answer to that question.
Does the Council consider that  on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty  national legislation on transparency can be regulated  that is to say legislation not relating to the EU' s institutions?
Mr Sjöstedt  the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.
Nevertheless  I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.
At the moment  there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article  and unless there is such a proposal  we cannot move forward on this matter.
In any event  Article 255 does not  at first sight  allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.
I am  up to a point  concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.
How is this to be done when  at the same time  the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked  so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents  reports  drafts etc?
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?
Mrs Frahm  the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards"   it also applies between the institutions.
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions  and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament  but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.
As a matter of fact  at the last conference  this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
The matter is still open.
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which  in my opinion  needs to be studied again  particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function  but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.
For our part  we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens  decision makers and authorities.
We are very anxious indeed that the EU  too  should move in this direction  and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
One or two years ago  Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning  in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.
My concern is  if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC  whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.
After all  examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference  which would mean widening the agenda.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos  transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.
This Intergovernmental Conference will  at the outset  concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate  particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic  more transparent and more efficient.
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will  of course  feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament  who will surely rally behind this proposal.
We will then see  at ministerial level  how we can follow this up.
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam  which was approved last May  and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress. The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.
My feeling is that  in spite of everything  this issue will always have to be on the agenda  because the public is clearly concerned about it  and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.
As far as we are concerned  they will be.
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000  and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year  given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?
What measures does the Council intend to adopt  and when  with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks  the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?
Mr President  the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question  particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way  and I shall explain how.
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.
Nevertheless  at the last Fisheries Council of 1999  held on 16 and 17 December  the Member States involved in this area of fishing  namely France  Spain and Portugal  considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes  as the Commission proposed  was excessively cautious.
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks  that is the species of fish being affected  and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species  of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX  the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000  for fishing in French waters.
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall  over the whole Community fishing area.
In accordance with the principle of relative stability  90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters  the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal' s point of view.
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea  which we also understand.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council  I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.
However  it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies  which  until 1995  were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds  through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France  should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.
It has been shown  as we have been claiming since 1995  that this move is appalling  and  if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement  that is fine by us  but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.
Today  scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction  and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.
I do not know if you are aware  representatives of the Council of Ministers  of your responsibility over these last few years  and in 2000 as well  for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.
I would like to say  Mr Ortuondo Larrea  that in its judgement of 5 October 1999  the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer  which was approved  was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and  specifically  with its Article 9(1)  which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.
Apart from this  Mr Ortuondo Larrea  the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way  on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.
Accordingly  Mr Ortuondo Larrea  the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer  greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.
In concrete terms  3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.
These numbers represent  in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council  a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999  NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies  Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings  abductions  detentions  intimidation  arson  looting  destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.
In the light of the above  will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo  as requested by Parliament?
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?
Mr Alavanos  I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities  for both the Serb and Romany populations  and the incidents of discrimination  harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.
The Council once again reiterated the need  in its December conclusions  to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and  in particular  to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians  we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population  the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.
It will not be tolerated  and must stop immediately.
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated.
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality  which underlies the European Union' s position  is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person' s ethnic origin.
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction  in its December conclusions  at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission  which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal  together with similar contributions made by Member States.
Nevertheless  Mr Alavanos  the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount  in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise  and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region' s multi-ethnic nature.
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal  its former president  Mr Soares  and its government  maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.
Today' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed  and one which I welcome.
However  there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.
Unfortunately  we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb  Romany  Turkish  and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.
The United Nation' s  and Mr Kouchner' s  mission in Kosovo ended in failure.
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing  we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner  who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.
Mr Alavanos  I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities  and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.
There is one thing  however  that we cannot deny  and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.
This is undeniable  even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts  for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control  have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.
I have one last point to make  which is about the European Union' s responsibility and  specifically  in this case  about possible action by the Council in this matter  and the responsibility of the international community  which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.
Therefore  the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.
It is the international community  and specifically the United Nations  which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and  in particular  for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.
These are questions which we should all be asking  but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.
Mr President  Mr President-in-Office of the Council  I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures  in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area  how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?
We have endeavoured to provide material help.
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?
Honorable Member! As I said I understand your concerns.
I think that  at the moment  particularly in the last few months  there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner  in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue  and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words  he has been given these resources.
There are two fundamental questions in particular.
Firstly  an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and  in particular  in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly  an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.
The issue which we should all raise  and I did so myself  in a diplomatic way  a while ago  concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue  but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.
Nevertheless  we must look at this resolution  and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because  as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world  we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process  and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.
What we have to do  and we in the European Union are already doing it  is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources  and you are right  Mr Rübig  we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.
Mr Seixas da Costa  I totally agree with you.
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working  namely Resolution 1244.
Having said this  the EU' s responsibility  which is both yours and ours  is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses  accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?
If so  does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region  avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States  as has tended to happen elsewhere  and reuniting the parties  in this case Kosovo and Albania?
Since the author is not present  Question No 7 lapses.
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban  rural and coastal development  the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.
However  housing is specifically excluded.
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest  including small cottages  and  given the need  for a variety of reasons  to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas  does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?
Mr President  the Council and  I think  the Portuguese Presidency in particular  are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development. This was  as you know  one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund  the EAGGF  this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas  an issue you are quite right to raise.
On the other hand  the European Regional Development Fund  the ERDF  also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion  by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.
In this regard  we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today  furthermore  is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also  have developed and changed.
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy  and the EAGGF  of course  has a crucial role to play in this.
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions  because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.
During the Portuguese Presidency  we will be continuing discussions on the CAP  by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes  paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.
On the other hand  the Portuguese Presidency will continue  if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office  which is by no means guaranteed  to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.
We think that the role of food safety  specifically in terms of everything linked to public health  is one of our presidency' s essential tasks.
It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes  in the Agriculture Council  the Health Council  the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council.
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June  the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market  to stabilise confidence in this market  to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope  at the end of it  to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming  mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks  in particular  against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where  of course  European standards of food safety do not apply.
I completely understand your concerns  and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.
We also have to think of the consequences  especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.
Nevertheless  as you know  this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.
The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.
Mr President  I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role  even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.
Mr Crowley  with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations  particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless  I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome  and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency  which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.
We have no specific  concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council  you have talked a lot about the future  about what the Commission will do  and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon  etc. However  you also said something which I find particularly frightening.
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead  partially at least  to exclusion.
I do not see how you could  with the views that you hold  provide any answers.
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on  for example  the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion  the division of work and social security  the implementation of tax policies  particularly for speculative capital  and the policy of redistributing wealth?
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening  through its right of initiative.
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it  and I have spoken about the future  because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion. One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion.
The second is to create internationally competitive conditions  which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union  and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can  in six months  resolve problems that have always existed.
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence. It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented  specifically by non-governmental organisations  but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.
We should  however  also bear in mind  Mr Papayannakis  that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact  armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies  regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term  some of the homeless may be dead  will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy  the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question  and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.
But there are some questions still outstanding.
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought  where the crops have failed  and where  in six months' time  we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.
At the same time  there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns  after which we will send the bread.
First of all  Mr Andrews  you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development.
There is no contradiction between our two positions  quite the opposite.
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs  we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face  particularly in the area of external relations.
As you can understand  it would be easy to do so.
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme  one after the other.
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve  particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.
You have mentioned Ethiopia  which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes  but there are  as you know  several Community actions to combat AIDS  and in this respect  you are right  and the United States will probably not do any better.
Indeed  in terms of development aid policy  I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.
Your question switched to the subject of arms  a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will  of course  address in the future  if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?
Since the author is not present  Question No 13 lapses.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council  and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.
Unfortunately  in my case  he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset  it should  in my view  demonstrate this in practice.
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is  I am afraid  just an excuse.
My question  which has not been answered  is why  when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union  the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.
This is a true example of the Council' s indifference towards culture  despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas  hops  cows and Indian hemp.
Mr Marinos  we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency  and therefore  the cultural dimension is  I am sure you will appreciate  one of our main concerns.
These cultural dimensions  however  almost always have their own economic dimension in turn  that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union  and especially within the framework of the Council.
For our part  we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere  because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union' s image and to the Union' s own particular identity.
This is  and will continue to be  connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.
As you know  both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately. In specific terms  we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations  at which this will be a central issue.
Nevertheless  I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy  and in particular the audiovisual dimension  the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.
We also intend to initiate a new debate  a more innovative one  on the issue of Europe' s film heritage  given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe  which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency  in conjunction with the Commission  in February 2000.
But  Mr Marinos  in the EU context  culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.
If  by chance  it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference  then this could be suggested  both by Member States  and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.
Of course  if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference  there might eventually be progress.
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.
We will soon see  and for our part  we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.
Mr President  I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it  you would consider it.
Well  I  and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.
I cannot think of a better way to do it.
Can you?
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.
This is an issue which  as you will understand  will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue  because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues  which crop up again and again  and which are passed from one conference to another  may be addressed.
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included  particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included  other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.
I would ask him to be brief.
Mr President  I understand that I have to do this very quickly.
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.
As I suspected  it was not exactly a procedural motion  but more a closing of the debate.
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa  but he can also write his letter to the three kings.
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.
It is not the Portuguese Presidency' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants  especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.
After this interesting exchange of opinions  and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure  I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes questions to the Council.
Capital tax
The next item is the joint debate on:
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others  to the Council  on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others  to the Commission  on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.
Madam President  Mr President-in-Office of the Council  Commissioner  during the Asian crisis in 1997  as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993  everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation  particularly currency speculation.
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days  this can equal the total figure of annual global production  or global GDP  of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can  in a few hours  cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country  plunging its whole population into recession.
In view of this situation  renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin  winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics  to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments  but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation  thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.
Note that this proposed tax  which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people  would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal  and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC  SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal  is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries  in areas such as education or health.
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President  Fernando Cardoso  the Finnish Government  the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.
The motion also asks that a position document  drawn up by the Commission and Council  should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.
The European Union must take the initiative and must also  as demanded in the motion  propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.
If the Union takes the initiative  this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world  including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people  their parliaments  their governments and their democratic institutions.
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today  with this debate and this motion  this question is now on the agenda of European construction.
Madam President  I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.
This is a creative initiative  which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics  but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative  the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.
Madam President  the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.
Such transactions  according to the argument  bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables.
This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.
Therefore  according to proponents  such as Mr Désir  an internationally applied Tobin tax would  in principle  reduce speculative transactions and  hence  the volatility of exchange rates  which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams  even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.
In reality  the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic. Indeed  it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international  public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax  such as the Tobin tax  as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation  so to speak.
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency  then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.
Put more strongly  in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds  the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.
In that case  the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.
Finally  even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies  there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected  and that is not the intention.
For the reasons set out above  I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.
At any rate  the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.
In more direct terms  to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams  this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.
The correct speculative approach  it seems to me  is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos  rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.
Madam President  Commissioner  I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism  and not just the economic and financial policy experts.
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability  as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us  is the result of speculation.
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden  they are calling for more bureaucracy  for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee  contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.
In my view  and I say this quite clearly  the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.
Mr Manders has the floor for a procedural motion.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you, the Bureau and all Members, a good transition into the new year.
Ladies and gentlemen, before you leave me alone, I would like on behalf of the Bureau, once again, to thank all the Members, all the services, officials, assistants and other co-workers and, if you will allow me - although all the co-workers work for us - perhaps a special mention should go to the language services which help us to understand each other here.
I would also like, although they are absent, to mention the Commission and the Council.
I am not going to re-open the 'Millennium or not the Millennium' debate, but I am going to wish all of you, and by extension, all the citizens of Europe which we represent, a happy year 2000.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 10.50 a.m.)
