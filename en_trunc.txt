<BOS> 

Good Morning, My name is Anmol Khanna. <EOS>
<BOS> Please rise  then  for this minute' s silence. <EOS>
<BOS> If the House agrees  I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested. <EOS>
<BOS> Madam President  on a point of order. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility. <EOS>
<BOS> It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability. <EOS>
<BOS> on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report. <EOS>
<BOS> We shall call him Mr Hicks. <EOS>
<BOS> This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Mr Segni  I shall do so gladly. <EOS>
<BOS> Indeed  it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted. <EOS>
<BOS> It is the case of Alexander Nikitin. <EOS>
<BOS> But  Madam President  my personal request has not been met. <EOS>
<BOS> It will  I hope  be examined in a positive light. <EOS>
<BOS> Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are there no fire instructions? <EOS>
<BOS> Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are no-smoking areas not enforced? <EOS>
<BOS> It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves. <EOS>
<BOS> I would ask that they reconsider  since this is not the case. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Berenguer Fuster  we shall check all this. <EOS>
<BOS> I admit that  at present  the matter seems to be somewhat confused. <EOS>
<BOS> Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there. <EOS>
<BOS> It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo. <EOS>
<BOS> As people have said  the situation there is extremely volatile. <EOS>
<BOS> There is  in fact  a risk of a military coup in the future. <EOS>
<BOS> We do not know what is happening. <EOS>
<BOS> So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people? <EOS>
<BOS> No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday. <EOS>
<BOS> That is  if he so wishes  of course. <EOS>
<BOS> According to its President  it is in a position to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Barón Crespo  you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion. <EOS>
<BOS> In the Conference of Presidents  we had an in-depth discussion. <EOS>
<BOS> Your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now. <EOS>
<BOS> We then put it to a vote. <EOS>
<BOS> There was a vote on this matter. <EOS>
<BOS> All of the others were of a different opinion. <EOS>
<BOS> That was the decision. <EOS>
<BOS> I should now like to comment on the issue itself. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no such document! <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February. <EOS>
<BOS> We have agreed to this. <EOS>
<BOS> That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group. <EOS>
<BOS> (Parliament rejected the request) President. <EOS>
<BOS> The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> Madam President  I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. <EOS>
<BOS> Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind. <EOS>
<BOS> That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Mr Poettering. <EOS>
<BOS> We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request. <EOS>
<BOS> It is not a lot to ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much. <EOS>
<BOS> Madam President  has my vote been counted? <EOS>
<BOS> I was unable to vote electronically  since I do not have a card. <EOS>
<BOS> My vote was "in favour" . <EOS>
<BOS> There is no room for amendments. <EOS>
<BOS> That did not happen. <EOS>
<BOS> This is an important matter. <EOS>
<BOS> You did not call me either. <EOS>
<BOS> I am terribly sorry  Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. <EOS>
<BOS> I did not see you asking to speak. <EOS>
<BOS> This seems to me to be a workable solution. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Cox  Mr Hänsch  would this be acceptable to you? <EOS>
<BOS> I would urge you to endorse this. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact  all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province. <EOS>
<BOS> I should like to address one final point. <EOS>
<BOS> I congratulate him on his excellent report. <EOS>
<BOS> Madam President  I would like to make a few comments. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a pity  in a sense. <EOS>
<BOS> In short  the issue is an important one. <EOS>
<BOS> The work is done. <EOS>
<BOS> All that remains is the business of enforcement. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to mention one final point. <EOS>
<BOS> This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period. <EOS>
<BOS> Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements. <EOS>
<BOS> This  however  does not seem feasible. <EOS>
<BOS> I should like to make just a few comments. <EOS>
<BOS> My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards. <EOS>
<BOS> My third point has also been mentioned already. <EOS>
<BOS> But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> In particular  annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. <EOS>
<BOS> In addition  the need for greater transparency has been pointed out. <EOS>
<BOS> This is in the special interest of northern European regions. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  colleagues  a happy new year and millennium to you all. <EOS>
<BOS> My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods. <EOS>
<BOS> According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. <EOS>
<BOS> There is support for the EU in Lapland also  so let us remember them. <EOS>
<BOS> I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought that it was quite superb. <EOS>
<BOS> This directive is a contribution to this. <EOS>
<BOS> What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance. <EOS>
<BOS> Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature. <EOS>
<BOS> This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind. <EOS>
<BOS> This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned. <EOS>
<BOS> In many ways  the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment. <EOS>
<BOS> Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions. <EOS>
<BOS> We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. <EOS>
<BOS> We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997. <EOS>
<BOS> We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen. <EOS>
<BOS> It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces. <EOS>
<BOS> We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality. <EOS>
<BOS> We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects. <EOS>
<BOS> Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent. <EOS>
<BOS> Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood. <EOS>
<BOS> The consequences do not inspire hope. <EOS>
<BOS> Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that this work has been carried out extremely well. <EOS>
<BOS> It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party. <EOS>
<BOS> I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation. <EOS>
<BOS> My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines. <EOS>
<BOS> They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape. <EOS>
<BOS> We are badly behind now in this matter. <EOS>
<BOS> For the time  the report grew too large when it was being debated. <EOS>
<BOS> It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports. <EOS>
<BOS> It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes. <EOS>
<BOS> This report is very good and our Group supports it. <EOS>
<BOS> We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results. <EOS>
<BOS> Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not think  however  that this report has come too late. <EOS>
<BOS> This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for. <EOS>
<BOS> This latter point is of particular importance. <EOS>
<BOS> We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone. <EOS>
<BOS> The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. <EOS>
<BOS> This time  however  I actually agree with her. <EOS>
<BOS> Nevertheless  I would like to commend her on her work. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately  this did not happen. <EOS>
<BOS> I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position. <EOS>
<BOS> Personally  I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines. <EOS>
<BOS> Therefore  the Commission should address the issue once and for all. <EOS>
<BOS> The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies. <EOS>
<BOS> Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking. <EOS>
<BOS> Europe should not be completely absent  as the states tend to want. <EOS>
<BOS> I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear. <EOS>
<BOS> Well  the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process. <EOS>
<BOS> The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere. <EOS>
<BOS> It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development. <EOS>
<BOS> This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to explain our thinking here. <EOS>
<BOS> Firstly  we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. <EOS>
<BOS> I urge the House to support these changes. <EOS>
<BOS> Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously. <EOS>
<BOS> Nonetheless  their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities. <EOS>
<BOS> They are growing  but only in terms of GDP. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the purpose of these guidelines. <EOS>
<BOS> I would thank you for your understanding in this matter. <EOS>
<BOS> So that is the first priority  the competitiveness of regional economies. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a situation which is  as it should be  unjustifiable and intolerable. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact  the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. <EOS>
<BOS> It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date. <EOS>
<BOS> Now to the form. <EOS>
<BOS> I actually quoted the text itself  in quotation marks. <EOS>
<BOS> I find the opposite the case. <EOS>
<BOS> We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions. <EOS>
<BOS> It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation. <EOS>
<BOS> This  Commissioner  is the first commandment for the coming period. <EOS>
<BOS> The report shows that growth has been uneven  despite all our efforts. <EOS>
<BOS> Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced. <EOS>
<BOS> For example  uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration. <EOS>
<BOS> Our Group is in favour of adopting this report. <EOS>
<BOS> This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. <EOS>
<BOS> They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities. <EOS>
<BOS> The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report. <EOS>
<BOS> Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for. <EOS>
<BOS> Surely this must be the ultimate goal. <EOS>
<BOS> I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the result? <EOS>
<BOS> People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust. <EOS>
<BOS> This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems. <EOS>
<BOS> We must give them this opportunity. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have. <EOS>
<BOS> The solution  as I see it  lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship. <EOS>
<BOS> By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business  but creating will. <EOS>
<BOS> What is a fair society? <EOS>
<BOS> In Reunion  for example  the rate is 37%. <EOS>
<BOS> It only remains to put this principle into practice. <EOS>
<BOS> I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much  Commissioner. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any comments? <EOS>
<BOS> I refer to item 11 on the order of business. <EOS>
<BOS> There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this. <EOS>
<BOS> That is something for which I have a deep appreciation. <EOS>
<BOS> It should not be dramatised into something more than that. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much  Mr Cox. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand what you are saying. <EOS>
<BOS> We have taken note of this. <EOS>
<BOS> It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Wynn  that makes sense. <EOS>
<BOS> The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Ahern  we have taken note of this. <EOS>
<BOS> We will also pass this on to our services  however. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much. <EOS>
<BOS> [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)]. <EOS>
<BOS> Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. <EOS>
<BOS> It should continue along this path. <EOS>
<BOS> Transparency and accountability belong together. <EOS>
<BOS> There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. <EOS>
<BOS> Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions. <EOS>
<BOS> But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord. <EOS>
<BOS> Competition yes  restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting. <EOS>
<BOS> The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly. <EOS>
<BOS> Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases. <EOS>
<BOS> Under Article 88  the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid. <EOS>
<BOS> The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996. <EOS>
<BOS> There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code. <EOS>
<BOS> No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  ladies and gentlemen  the internal market is not complete. <EOS>
<BOS> Subsidies  monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike. <EOS>
<BOS> Subsidies distort allocations  both within and between countries. <EOS>
<BOS> This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies  both private and public. <EOS>
<BOS> Public monopolies are  more often than not  phased out reluctantly. <EOS>
<BOS> Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures. <EOS>
<BOS> Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living. <EOS>
<BOS> It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact  competition policy and consumer policy belong together. <EOS>
<BOS> The internal market is the basis for our work. <EOS>
<BOS> Its legislation is to apply equally to all  to large and small countries alike. <EOS>
<BOS> The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed. <EOS>
<BOS> The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition. <EOS>
<BOS> We have a quite exciting debate in front of us. <EOS>
<BOS> All this is to the good of the consumer. <EOS>
<BOS> The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement. <EOS>
<BOS> But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy. <EOS>
<BOS> One is subsidiarity. <EOS>
<BOS> Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union. <EOS>
<BOS> This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention. <EOS>
<BOS> I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation. <EOS>
<BOS> To conclude  I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much  Mr Radwan. <EOS>
<BOS> A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures. <EOS>
<BOS> The market favours the short term and immediate profits. <EOS>
<BOS> In order to function  the market needs rules. <EOS>
<BOS> We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally  aid can enable restructuring  offer training  save jobs and thus know-how. <EOS>
<BOS> It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid. <EOS>
<BOS> We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point. <EOS>
<BOS> We want a true culture of competition in Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. <EOS>
<BOS> How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back? <EOS>
<BOS> This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition. <EOS>
<BOS> You have shown us the way  Mr Monti  with the single market scoreboard. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  Commissioner  there are just two questions which must be answered. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we not be discussing this issue? <EOS>
<BOS> When will we debate that? <EOS>
<BOS> Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights. <EOS>
<BOS> Having said that  governing means planning. <EOS>
<BOS> The rapporteur' s Amendments Nos 6 and 7  therefore  deserve our support. <EOS>
<BOS> Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit. <EOS>
<BOS> If this comes to nothing  then the government has to step in. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission' s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper. <EOS>
<BOS> This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry. <EOS>
<BOS> It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views. <EOS>
<BOS> Firstly  these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application. <EOS>
<BOS> It is true  there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way. <EOS>
<BOS> Secondly  I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty. <EOS>
<BOS> Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern. <EOS>
<BOS> This instrument will fall by the wayside in future. <EOS>
<BOS> They are still in training  as it were. <EOS>
<BOS> For this reason  modernisation was essential. <EOS>
<BOS> That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. <EOS>
<BOS> National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time. <EOS>
<BOS> A reform of this point was therefore also necessary. <EOS>
<BOS> The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762. <EOS>
<BOS> The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous. <EOS>
<BOS> It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape. <EOS>
<BOS> It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis. <EOS>
<BOS> The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals. <EOS>
<BOS> Secondly  Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation. <EOS>
<BOS> For these reasons  we are going to vote in favour of the report. <EOS>
<BOS> Frankly  I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory. <EOS>
<BOS> Various arguments have been presented in its favour. <EOS>
<BOS> This is why I give this report my full support. <EOS>
<BOS> The truth is that the single market is not yet complete. <EOS>
<BOS> We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals. <EOS>
<BOS> We look to him as the man to root out cartels. <EOS>
<BOS> The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy. <EOS>
<BOS> I know that the Commission is set against this  but the potential exists. <EOS>
<BOS> I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court. <EOS>
<BOS> Well  we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> So  judicially  something needs to be done. <EOS>
<BOS> In relation to legal certainty  I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen. <EOS>
<BOS> It is important that business has legal certainty. <EOS>
<BOS> I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently. <EOS>
<BOS> He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that. <EOS>
<BOS> We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision. <EOS>
<BOS> Society is surrendering itself to the economy. <EOS>
<BOS> That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union. <EOS>
<BOS> It is essential that this long overdue step be taken. <EOS>
<BOS> It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection. <EOS>
<BOS> Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  Commissioner  competition is exactly what we need. <EOS>
<BOS> I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this. <EOS>
<BOS> I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. <EOS>
<BOS> Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper. <EOS>
<BOS> No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. <EOS>
<BOS> But opinion differs as to the solution. <EOS>
<BOS> Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions. <EOS>
<BOS> This is unacceptable to my mind. <EOS>
<BOS> This is unacceptable in my view. <EOS>
<BOS> It would weaken a key element of European policy. <EOS>
<BOS> There was no majority for this at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> I consider this to be unacceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission suggests shorter deadlines. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree with this request. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree with the rapporteur on two issues. <EOS>
<BOS> I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias. <EOS>
<BOS> With global markets  we need global employment laws and global subsidies. <EOS>
<BOS> However  it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity. <EOS>
<BOS> Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business. <EOS>
<BOS> With what aim? <EOS>
<BOS> Not to save jobs. <EOS>
<BOS> All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies. <EOS>
<BOS> Did these firms need state aid to survive? <EOS>
<BOS> No  car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years. <EOS>
<BOS> In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions. <EOS>
<BOS> The principle of competition must now be universal in its application. <EOS>
<BOS> The form the aid takes is important. <EOS>
<BOS> Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported. <EOS>
<BOS> In his report  Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well. <EOS>
<BOS> But Europe is changing. <EOS>
<BOS> The economies are growing  we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy. <EOS>
<BOS> It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy. <EOS>
<BOS> This is not in question. <EOS>
<BOS> Having said this  I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation. <EOS>
<BOS> In the Netherlands  the competition authority is still in its infancy. <EOS>
<BOS> Uniformity needs to be worked on. <EOS>
<BOS> This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this? <EOS>
<BOS> But we all want to be oarsmen on it. <EOS>
<BOS> We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you. <EOS>
<BOS> The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories. <EOS>
<BOS> I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed. <EOS>
<BOS> Secondly  we have the issue of companies' legal certainty. <EOS>
<BOS> We all agree on this. <EOS>
<BOS> On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said. <EOS>
<BOS> There have only been nine rejections. <EOS>
<BOS> But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer. <EOS>
<BOS> This is therefore an aspect to be considered. <EOS>
<BOS> Thirdly  we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law. <EOS>
<BOS> In this respect  the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon. <EOS>
<BOS> Here improvements should be made. <EOS>
<BOS> Only in certain countries  Germany for example  is there specialised jurisdiction. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore  but we must also explore others. <EOS>
<BOS> Commissioner  it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform. <EOS>
<BOS> It transcends competition  it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. <EOS>
<BOS> In my opinion  Mr President  this joint debate fully bears this out. <EOS>
<BOS> I will take these very quickly one at a time. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy. <EOS>
<BOS> Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation  not renationalisation  of competition law. <EOS>
<BOS> This then is the idea of monitoring implementation. <EOS>
<BOS> This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns  Mrs Peijs. <EOS>
<BOS> There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. <EOS>
<BOS> Many speakers have underlined this. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs. <EOS>
<BOS> We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Is this simply a political gesture? <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share. <EOS>
<BOS> The fourth group is legal certainty. <EOS>
<BOS> (FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers. <EOS>
<BOS> This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof. <EOS>
<BOS> The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion. <EOS>
<BOS> I will mention only two  in order to be brief. <EOS>
<BOS> The first is greater transparency. <EOS>
<BOS> I am especially grateful for all of this. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Commissioner Monti. <EOS>
<BOS> The joint debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures. <EOS>
<BOS> After five years only four have done so. <EOS>
<BOS> I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment. <EOS>
<BOS> The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. <EOS>
<BOS> The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. <EOS>
<BOS> This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4). <EOS>
<BOS> The Treaty is a collection of complex articles. <EOS>
<BOS> But be careful. <EOS>
<BOS> The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  this  as Mrs Theato said  is a critical report. <EOS>
<BOS> It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to do something about it. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to take this responsibility seriously. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. <EOS>
<BOS> The question is: who prosecutes? <EOS>
<BOS> That is where we really get into difficulty. <EOS>
<BOS> We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one. <EOS>
<BOS> We are aware that it is a delicate debate. <EOS>
<BOS> But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report. <EOS>
<BOS> But the Member States failed to cooperate. <EOS>
<BOS> I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic. <EOS>
<BOS> This  I thought  is no longer permissible  certainly not at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to make one general point on politics. <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever we may say about the European elections  the low turnout is a fact. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I too would like to thank the rapporteur. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions. <EOS>
<BOS> Yet  every year we have the same problem. <EOS>
<BOS> It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that the debate will convince a few more people. <EOS>
<BOS> So the legal framework  Mr President  is already in place. <EOS>
<BOS> It is fine  in principle. <EOS>
<BOS> It need only be fine-tuned. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason. <EOS>
<BOS> The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty  i.e. <EOS>
<BOS> And indeed there is a twofold shift. <EOS>
<BOS> The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not believe so. <EOS>
<BOS> On the other hand  we can go a long way using the existing tools. <EOS>
<BOS> It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for. <EOS>
<BOS> However  it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office. <EOS>
<BOS> Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  we all want to do something about combating European fraud. <EOS>
<BOS> But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well? <EOS>
<BOS> The answer to this is that we know very little about this. <EOS>
<BOS> The Tampere Summit was about combating crime. <EOS>
<BOS> So a great deal has to be done in this area. <EOS>
<BOS> And what exactly should be done? <EOS>
<BOS> Two things  and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out. <EOS>
<BOS> So  unification in this small area. <EOS>
<BOS> The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of. <EOS>
<BOS> I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on. <EOS>
<BOS> It is  in fact  something very positive. <EOS>
<BOS> Just like Europol. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament supports this. <EOS>
<BOS> The Committee of Wise Men supports this. <EOS>
<BOS> I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris. <EOS>
<BOS> I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue. <EOS>
<BOS> We need a public debate on this. <EOS>
<BOS> Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law. <EOS>
<BOS> We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee. <EOS>
<BOS> This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I would very much just like to add to two particular points. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion  but I digress. <EOS>
<BOS> The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report. <EOS>
<BOS> I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2. <EOS>
<BOS> We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis. <EOS>
<BOS> We also face difficulties with regard to offences. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing has changed there. <EOS>
<BOS> Nevertheless  it raises some very basic questions. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny. <EOS>
<BOS> Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged. <EOS>
<BOS> To remedy this  vigorous efforts are required. <EOS>
<BOS> We have more confidence in Eurojust  where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate. <EOS>
<BOS> We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report. <EOS>
<BOS> The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision. <EOS>
<BOS> Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities. <EOS>
<BOS> I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Commissioner Schreyer. <EOS>
<BOS> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
VOTE
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). <EOS>
<BOS> These are both about voting. <EOS>
<BOS> That is quite right  Mr Heaton-Harris. <EOS>
<BOS> I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it. <EOS>
<BOS> This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us. <EOS>
<BOS> There is as yet no federal European tax. <EOS>
<BOS> Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament voted in favour of this text. <EOS>
<BOS> The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then. <EOS>
<BOS> This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999. <EOS>
<BOS> The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted. <EOS>
<BOS> Until then  there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations. <EOS>
<BOS> I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time. <EOS>
<BOS> The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year. <EOS>
<BOS> In order to reduce disparities between regions  of course. <EOS>
<BOS> These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid. <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime  let us support this first step. <EOS>
<BOS> In my mind  illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping. <EOS>
<BOS> Illegal state aid  by contrast  destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment. <EOS>
<BOS> This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion. <EOS>
<BOS> In general  the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent. <EOS>
<BOS> We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues. <EOS>
<BOS> This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level. <EOS>
<BOS> Expenditure becomes an end in itself  evidence of the success of a programme. <EOS>
<BOS> The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment. <EOS>
<BOS> In 1996 it was 50%. <EOS>
<BOS> Progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a generalised tendency  sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes  nor Alsace. <EOS>
<BOS> As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. <EOS>
<BOS> A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today. <EOS>
<BOS> It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. <EOS>
<BOS> Issues of mergers and state aid however  still remain within the notification system. <EOS>
<BOS> This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> Admittedly  this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling. <EOS>
<BOS> It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term. <EOS>
<BOS> Indeed  this is one advantage of the present system. <EOS>
<BOS> This is repulsive most of all in social terms. <EOS>
<BOS> Excessive in comparison with what iron rule  what criteria of efficiency? <EOS>
<BOS> Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness. <EOS>
<BOS> The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> This  indeed  is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code. <EOS>
<BOS> The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion. <EOS>
<BOS> You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> What are the conditions for this recognition? <EOS>
<BOS> What guarantees are there of its reliability? <EOS>
<BOS> You are going to commission a fact-finding mission. <EOS>
<BOS> We await the outcome with great interest. <EOS>
<BOS> Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up. <EOS>
<BOS> This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries. <EOS>
<BOS> Why not? <EOS>
<BOS> What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw? <EOS>
<BOS> Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster. <EOS>
<BOS> We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively. <EOS>
<BOS> The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. <EOS>
<BOS> Just as the Sea Empress  just as the Braer did. <EOS>
<BOS> It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster. <EOS>
<BOS> The time for resolutions has passed. <EOS>
<BOS> What is now needed is action. <EOS>
<BOS> We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  Commissioner  I have brought you a small gift. <EOS>
<BOS> When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?" <EOS>
<BOS> Why  in these circumstances  is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised? <EOS>
<BOS> I can testify to this remarkable work. <EOS>
<BOS> Once again  there will be no clearly defined party responsible. <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime  it is nature that is taking the rap  as always. <EOS>
<BOS> Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers. <EOS>
<BOS> This is no longer tolerable. <EOS>
<BOS> Next  we have flags of convenience. <EOS>
<BOS> This is no longer tolerable. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally  there is the lack of transparency. <EOS>
<BOS> This is no longer tolerable. <EOS>
<BOS> I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance. <EOS>
<BOS> Quite clearly  we are now paying the price for our lack of concern. <EOS>
<BOS> So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion. <EOS>
<BOS> The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO. <EOS>
<BOS> This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings. <EOS>
<BOS> It is now scheduled for July. <EOS>
<BOS> This must be brought forward. <EOS>
<BOS> The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict. <EOS>
<BOS> I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities. <EOS>
<BOS> This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age. <EOS>
<BOS> Thus  the Erika was refused access to American waters. <EOS>
<BOS> And now the Erika. <EOS>
<BOS> Whose turn is next? <EOS>
<BOS> And this is the result. <EOS>
<BOS> There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters  they are the result of fate. <EOS>
<BOS> They are the result of human thoughtlessness. <EOS>
<BOS> What we have here is an ecological disaster. <EOS>
<BOS> The Erika disaster must be the last in the series. <EOS>
<BOS> First of all  we must shed some light on this shipwreck. <EOS>
<BOS> We know what actually happened. <EOS>
<BOS> I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. <EOS>
<BOS> We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. <EOS>
<BOS> The 15 clearly do not suffice. <EOS>
<BOS> These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. <EOS>
<BOS> In other words  we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. <EOS>
<BOS> Many thanks for this. <EOS>
<BOS> The damage suffered  also in ecological terms  cannot be expressed in money. <EOS>
<BOS> Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members. <EOS>
<BOS> Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner? <EOS>
<BOS> So this 25% should be increased. <EOS>
<BOS> But this is not in place. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I would welcome some action in this area. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  we have already had this discussion so many times in the past. <EOS>
<BOS> So what are we to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> What are we to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> I will tell you a few things we should do. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course  we need double-hulled vessels. <EOS>
<BOS> So what do we need to happen immediately? <EOS>
<BOS> This is what we need for ships. <EOS>
<BOS> We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability. <EOS>
<BOS> This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision! <EOS>
<BOS> Environmental standards will be a recurring theme. <EOS>
<BOS> The unions will have something to say as will industry. <EOS>
<BOS> A long memory will serve us well  ladies and gentlemen. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts. <EOS>
<BOS> We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures. <EOS>
<BOS> Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had? <EOS>
<BOS> We must also critically examine the classification societies. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not think that we can accept their procedures. <EOS>
<BOS> We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control. <EOS>
<BOS> However  we must stick to the facts. <EOS>
<BOS> I cannot accept this. <EOS>
<BOS> This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit. <EOS>
<BOS> There are reputable companies too. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I welcome the statement from the Commissioner. <EOS>
<BOS> This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources. <EOS>
<BOS> They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection. <EOS>
<BOS> I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways. <EOS>
<BOS> On the other hand  prevention is essential. <EOS>
<BOS> That should be the starting point for our efforts. <EOS>
<BOS> Once we have done that  our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified. <EOS>
<BOS> It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries. <EOS>
<BOS> I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard. <EOS>
<BOS> We sometimes regulate things which could  by and large  remain subsidiary. <EOS>
<BOS> In this area we must respond to public opinion. <EOS>
<BOS> So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods. <EOS>
<BOS> The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection. <EOS>
<BOS> States can carry out port inspections. <EOS>
<BOS> It is clear that there is no lack of legislation. <EOS>
<BOS> In my opinion  the Commissioner is quite right. <EOS>
<BOS> Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation. <EOS>
<BOS> Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored? <EOS>
<BOS> The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled. <EOS>
<BOS> There are four more sister ships in service at present. <EOS>
<BOS> Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag. <EOS>
<BOS> Are we waiting for the next accident to happen? <EOS>
<BOS> Would sanctions not be appropriate  as the Commissioner stated  for the classification society? <EOS>
<BOS> RINA is currently the talk of the town. <EOS>
<BOS> Malta is entering the accession negotiations. <EOS>
<BOS> Like so many others  I too wonder where the people responsible are. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur? <EOS>
<BOS> I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage. <EOS>
<BOS> This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions. <EOS>
<BOS> Ultimately  the polluter must pay. <EOS>
<BOS> The victims are waiting outside. <EOS>
<BOS> They want answers. <EOS>
<BOS> Who will provide us with new jobs? <EOS>
<BOS> That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms. <EOS>
<BOS> It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" . <EOS>
<BOS> But there is an art to that as well. <EOS>
<BOS> We are therefore right to demand improved controls  sanctions and preventive measures. <EOS>
<BOS> The issue is as topical as it was before. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done. <EOS>
<BOS> During these years  the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the reality. <EOS>
<BOS> Flags of convenience are one problem  but are not the only one. <EOS>
<BOS> Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community. <EOS>
<BOS> We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end. <EOS>
<BOS> We already have legislation. <EOS>
<BOS> Lastly  I would like to stress the issue of liability. <EOS>
<BOS> I will end now. <EOS>
<BOS> I will not expand further. <EOS>
<BOS> We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much  Commissioner. <EOS>
<BOS> We have taken good note of your intentions. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that you must have done so  because you have not mentioned it. <EOS>
<BOS> We should therefore put this situation right immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me explain. <EOS>
<BOS> The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years. <EOS>
<BOS> It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one. <EOS>
<BOS> We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact. <EOS>
<BOS> They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens. <EOS>
<BOS> EUR 11 billion. <EOS>
<BOS> I can show you a copy if you wish. <EOS>
<BOS> That  however  is another problem altogether. <EOS>
<BOS> These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests. <EOS>
<BOS> I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. <EOS>
<BOS> This programme must work at full capacity. <EOS>
<BOS> These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States. <EOS>
<BOS> Current programmes must be accelerated. <EOS>
<BOS> The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term. <EOS>
<BOS> Commissioner  Mr President  Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto. <EOS>
<BOS> However  it has now achieved notoriety. <EOS>
<BOS> All this is well-intentioned advice. <EOS>
<BOS> "We do not have the wherewithal for that " they said. <EOS>
<BOS> This is wrong! <EOS>
<BOS> And no one can comprehend this attitude. <EOS>
<BOS> Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss. <EOS>
<BOS> The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity  also from within this Community. <EOS>
<BOS> I say they have a right to solidarity. <EOS>
<BOS> Permit me one further comment. <EOS>
<BOS> The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency. <EOS>
<BOS> We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment. <EOS>
<BOS> It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters. <EOS>
<BOS> There have always been natural disasters and there always will be. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course  there is a need for solidarity here. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course  I am in favour of providing assistance where we can. <EOS>
<BOS> The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate. <EOS>
<BOS> We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream. <EOS>
<BOS> But in common with others  we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect. <EOS>
<BOS> We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims. <EOS>
<BOS> This is an irreparable loss. <EOS>
<BOS> Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals. <EOS>
<BOS> That is important. <EOS>
<BOS> It was very small. <EOS>
<BOS> So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished. <EOS>
<BOS> I think we should reinstate this budget line. <EOS>
<BOS> The same when the floods came in France and the same again now. <EOS>
<BOS> Ladies and gentlemen  none of us must forget what has taken place. <EOS>
<BOS> It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. <EOS>
<BOS> For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow. <EOS>
<BOS> The calculations are in decades rather than years. <EOS>
<BOS> We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank. <EOS>
<BOS> I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland. <EOS>
<BOS> Natural habitats were destroyed. <EOS>
<BOS> So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case. <EOS>
<BOS> I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force. <EOS>
<BOS> That concludes the debate. <EOS>
<BOS> The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday. <EOS>
<BOS> At my hearing last September  I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper. <EOS>
<BOS> I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. <EOS>
<BOS> This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers  producers and industry generally. <EOS>
<BOS> Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees. <EOS>
<BOS> High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness. <EOS>
<BOS> The challenge is to make the system the very best. <EOS>
<BOS> We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change. <EOS>
<BOS> We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders. <EOS>
<BOS> All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent  understandable and flexible. <EOS>
<BOS> Over 80 measures are envisaged. <EOS>
<BOS> This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate. <EOS>
<BOS> It has already attracted much comment  including reactions from Members of Parliament. <EOS>
<BOS> We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage. <EOS>
<BOS> I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments. <EOS>
<BOS> Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change? <EOS>
<BOS> The first key concern is independence. <EOS>
<BOS> We must also ensure excellence and transparency. <EOS>
<BOS> However  the Commission believes that we must go further. <EOS>
<BOS> As the White Paper makes clear  the new authority must be a value-added structure. <EOS>
<BOS> Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists. <EOS>
<BOS> This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion. <EOS>
<BOS> I also reject this line of argument. <EOS>
<BOS> Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens? <EOS>
<BOS> It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a major task. <EOS>
<BOS> I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard. <EOS>
<BOS> The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis. <EOS>
<BOS> It is essential that we get the mix right. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I thank the Commissioner for his statement. <EOS>
<BOS> That is very much the right approach. <EOS>
<BOS> But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that we can thrash this out. <EOS>
<BOS> It is very important that we include liability in that process. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the one word I am talking about. <EOS>
<BOS> The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> That cannot continue. <EOS>
<BOS> My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed. <EOS>
<BOS> You are unclear about this in your White Paper. <EOS>
<BOS> That is another point  i.e. <EOS>
<BOS> the question of obligation  which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Commissioner  for your statement. <EOS>
<BOS> We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability. <EOS>
<BOS> Once that is done  issues such as liability can be addressed. <EOS>
<BOS> But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list. <EOS>
<BOS> Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed. <EOS>
<BOS> I also welcome the White Paper. <EOS>
<BOS> I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location? <EOS>
<BOS> In addition to that  the food safety authority will have a board. <EOS>
<BOS> We have not done that yet but it will be done in September. <EOS>
<BOS> That would erode the independence of the scientific advice. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that. <EOS>
<BOS> That is an issue for consideration and discussion. <EOS>
<BOS> There may be a number of views on that. <EOS>
<BOS> It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity. <EOS>
<BOS> It must be visible. <EOS>
<BOS> It must be known. <EOS>
<BOS> Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority. <EOS>
<BOS> It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous. <EOS>
<BOS> It must be visible. <EOS>
<BOS> I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> There would have to be an interaction at scientific level. <EOS>
<BOS> That is an undesirable situation  we do not want that situation in the future. <EOS>
<BOS> This situation can be achieved over a period of time. <EOS>
<BOS> You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. <EOS>
<BOS> It is something that is earned over a period of time. <EOS>
<BOS> In relation to grants and subsidies: yes  consideration has been given to that issue. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority. <EOS>
<BOS> But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority. <EOS>
<BOS> The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different. <EOS>
<BOS> It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located. <EOS>
<BOS> That is my judgement at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> Colleagues  I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> That concludes the debate. <EOS>
<BOS> Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). <EOS>
<BOS> We will examine questions to the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event. <EOS>
<BOS> Turkey's nuclear plans ? <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you for your reply. <EOS>
<BOS> I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country. <EOS>
<BOS> This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%. <EOS>
<BOS> So much for the political aspect. <EOS>
<BOS> Now to the technical aspect. <EOS>
<BOS> In cases such as this  where there is uncertainty  simulators are used. <EOS>
<BOS> However  we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy. <EOS>
<BOS> I have explained the position of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety. <EOS>
<BOS> In the case of Turkey it is different. <EOS>
<BOS> The plant is not yet there. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not have these concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> If not  why not? <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Mr Bowe  for your question. <EOS>
<BOS> As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. <EOS>
<BOS> None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment. <EOS>
<BOS> No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission. <EOS>
<BOS> Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed. <EOS>
<BOS> How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Mr Bowe  for that question. <EOS>
<BOS> That is also mentioned in the report. <EOS>
<BOS> We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast. <EOS>
<BOS> That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do. <EOS>
<BOS> In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution. <EOS>
<BOS> I cannot answer that question. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information. <EOS>
<BOS> Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way. <EOS>
<BOS> When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet? <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared. <EOS>
<BOS> We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. <EOS>
<BOS> I urge the Chinese again to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is. <EOS>
<BOS> Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course. <EOS>
<BOS> I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet. <EOS>
<BOS> Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission  like others  has urged dialogue. <EOS>
<BOS> The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes. <EOS>
<BOS> right to proper administration in the EU. <EOS>
<BOS> Are these reports accurate? <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I would like to thank the Commissioner. <EOS>
<BOS> The newspaper reports were misleading. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman. <EOS>
<BOS> It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved? <EOS>
<BOS> The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis. <EOS>
<BOS> As the author is not present  Question No 32 lapses. <EOS>
<BOS> I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. <EOS>
<BOS> I am sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> According to the Rules of Procedure  you are not required to reply. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish you a good evening. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa. <EOS>
<BOS> To achieve that  the Council's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety. <EOS>
<BOS> Is the Commission prepared to take such measures? <EOS>
<BOS> The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory. <EOS>
<BOS> It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" . <EOS>
<BOS> In addition  measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender. <EOS>
<BOS> It would appear that we are in agreement about this. <EOS>
<BOS> Only one manager has participated in gender training  and for half a day. <EOS>
<BOS> That is naturally unacceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson. <EOS>
<BOS> That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority. <EOS>
<BOS> So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said. <EOS>
<BOS> The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme. <EOS>
<BOS> These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent  Tajikistan. <EOS>
<BOS> Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999. <EOS>
<BOS> Over the same period  Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million. <EOS>
<BOS> I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them. <EOS>
<BOS> I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well. <EOS>
<BOS> We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact. <EOS>
<BOS> There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to. <EOS>
<BOS> This is not the usual state of affairs. <EOS>
<BOS> And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much  Mr Patten  for your interventions today. <EOS>
<BOS> The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Commissioner for your reply. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell me that you  as the Commission  have made recommendations. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to. <EOS>
<BOS> Did anyone find work? <EOS>
<BOS> How many people found work? <EOS>
<BOS> What has been done about training? <EOS>
<BOS> Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees? <EOS>
<BOS> Do we have any figures? <EOS>
<BOS> The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines. <EOS>
<BOS> As you know  there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated. <EOS>
<BOS> So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that the answer is brief and clear. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course it is as you say. <EOS>
<BOS> The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament has proposed 4 years  the Commission 7 and the Council 13. <EOS>
<BOS> Which Commissioners are members of this group? <EOS>
<BOS> How many meetings of the group have been held to date? <EOS>
<BOS> What concrete measures have been discussed? <EOS>
<BOS> This question covers several individual matters. <EOS>
<BOS> It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi  Vice-President Kinnock  Mr Reding and myself. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Avilés-Perea  that was an exhortation rather than a question. <EOS>
<BOS> But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ... <EOS>
<BOS> Allow me to say just one word. <EOS>
<BOS> What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes? <EOS>
<BOS> The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. <EOS>
<BOS> The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people. <EOS>
<BOS> Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace. <EOS>
<BOS> This is an important aspect of this initiative. <EOS>
<BOS> The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the same as the Social Fund regulation  i.e. <EOS>
<BOS> EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation. <EOS>
<BOS> It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month. <EOS>
<BOS> The Member States  i.e. <EOS>
<BOS> The last question concerns the amount granted. <EOS>
<BOS> Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. <EOS>
<BOS> The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. <EOS>
<BOS> 4.2). <EOS>
<BOS> Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the sort of exemption we are talking about. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination. <EOS>
<BOS> Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression. <EOS>
<BOS> In other words  it is positive discrimination. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006  i.e. <EOS>
<BOS> EUR 195 billion  will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources. <EOS>
<BOS> I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to. <EOS>
<BOS> I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commissioner accepts and takes good note of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s intervention. <EOS>
<BOS> These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme. <EOS>
<BOS> Firstly  I agree with you entirely. <EOS>
<BOS> Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned. <EOS>
<BOS> Since the author is not present  Question No 43 lapses. <EOS>
<BOS> What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area? <EOS>
<BOS> I would thank the Commissioner for her answer. <EOS>
<BOS> I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan. <EOS>
<BOS> It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level. <EOS>
<BOS> What it says it that one of two things may apply  i.e. <EOS>
<BOS> We are waiting to see what the next move will be. <EOS>
<BOS> It is not only Denmark which has matters pending. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much  Commissioner  for your dedication. <EOS>
<BOS> You have fulfilled your objective for today  which is to answer all the questions. <EOS>
<BOS> We congratulate you. <EOS>
<BOS> That concludes Question Time. <EOS>
<BOS> It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans. <EOS>
<BOS> We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation  and this is now in place. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated. <EOS>
<BOS> This has now been done. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets. <EOS>
<BOS> This is in place too. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges. <EOS>
<BOS> It did this as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices. <EOS>
<BOS> We want more than that  however. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme. <EOS>
<BOS> We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points. <EOS>
<BOS> Firstly  Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents. <EOS>
<BOS> I would quote Gaza as an example. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  since 1996  the discharge has acquired a heavy  political significance. <EOS>
<BOS> This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally  this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic. <EOS>
<BOS> They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them. <EOS>
<BOS> That cannot excuse everything that we came across. <EOS>
<BOS> From what I have seen of the reform process  it looks good. <EOS>
<BOS> But we need that reform process. <EOS>
<BOS> It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it. <EOS>
<BOS> It groups them together and that is very important. <EOS>
<BOS> There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to. <EOS>
<BOS> One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> We have to get this right. <EOS>
<BOS> The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly. <EOS>
<BOS> We have to remedy that. <EOS>
<BOS> The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms. <EOS>
<BOS> We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending. <EOS>
<BOS> We are discussing last year' s discharge  but also the Commission' s responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> It is about a Commission which is no more. <EOS>
<BOS> There is now a new Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month. <EOS>
<BOS> It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled. <EOS>
<BOS> This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed. <EOS>
<BOS> Take  for example  the pledges made by the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> They look good in themselves. <EOS>
<BOS> The previous speaker already said something about this. <EOS>
<BOS> This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results. <EOS>
<BOS> This also applies to whistle-blowers. <EOS>
<BOS> We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type. <EOS>
<BOS> Clear progress must be visible. <EOS>
<BOS> Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value. <EOS>
<BOS> In that year  we voted against granting discharge. <EOS>
<BOS> As a result  we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997  too. <EOS>
<BOS> It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised. <EOS>
<BOS> The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts. <EOS>
<BOS> We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution. <EOS>
<BOS> That is just the way things are  however. <EOS>
<BOS> This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed. <EOS>
<BOS> I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate. <EOS>
<BOS> I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO. <EOS>
<BOS> From the outside  it looks as if the Commission has something to hide. <EOS>
<BOS> My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case. <EOS>
<BOS> It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall. <EOS>
<BOS> Otherwise  we cannot carry out our work. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Commissioner Schreyer. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. <EOS>
<BOS> A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted. <EOS>
<BOS> New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials. <EOS>
<BOS> The number of departments has been reduced. <EOS>
<BOS> In order to achieve this  action is required in four areas. <EOS>
<BOS> First  financial management and control within the Commission must be improved. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control. <EOS>
<BOS> A new independent audit system service must be set up. <EOS>
<BOS> It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time. <EOS>
<BOS> Urgent change is required today. <EOS>
<BOS> Third  standards in European public life must be upheld. <EOS>
<BOS> A number of codes have since been introduced. <EOS>
<BOS> They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding. <EOS>
<BOS> Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected. <EOS>
<BOS> They must be implemented without delay. <EOS>
<BOS> Crucially  reforms must not be limited to the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally  the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised. <EOS>
<BOS> It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern  multinational organisation. <EOS>
<BOS> A career with the European institutions must become more attractive. <EOS>
<BOS> Too many young  new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years. <EOS>
<BOS> The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent. <EOS>
<BOS> Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed. <EOS>
<BOS> It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions. <EOS>
<BOS> Commissioner Kinnock will  tomorrow  present his communication on reform. <EOS>
<BOS> This communication must contain a clear timetable. <EOS>
<BOS> Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away. <EOS>
<BOS> There is a very simple way to deal with those stories. <EOS>
<BOS> Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism. <EOS>
<BOS> Have the lessons not been learnt? <EOS>
<BOS> Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report. <EOS>
<BOS> It is an excellent report. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse. <EOS>
<BOS> I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far. <EOS>
<BOS> He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change. <EOS>
<BOS> Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation. <EOS>
<BOS> That is important. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another. <EOS>
<BOS> Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal. <EOS>
<BOS> I will give you one example of this. <EOS>
<BOS> It is clear that is not acceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation? <EOS>
<BOS> We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working. <EOS>
<BOS> But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated. <EOS>
<BOS> We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. <EOS>
<BOS> We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves. <EOS>
<BOS> Our own staff policy is outdated. <EOS>
<BOS> Some of our working practices need radical reform. <EOS>
<BOS> We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting. <EOS>
<BOS> European taxpayers need to be re-assured. <EOS>
<BOS> That is the key issue  delivery of these proposals. <EOS>
<BOS> We have submitted an amendment to this effect. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired. <EOS>
<BOS> I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control. <EOS>
<BOS> This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. <EOS>
<BOS> The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Is this possible? <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten. <EOS>
<BOS> It is his first report here in plenary. <EOS>
<BOS> It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late. <EOS>
<BOS> Let us be honest. <EOS>
<BOS> The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September. <EOS>
<BOS> We are now four months down the line. <EOS>
<BOS> Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening? <EOS>
<BOS> I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to end on the following point. <EOS>
<BOS> Fraud  mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere. <EOS>
<BOS> They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow. <EOS>
<BOS> Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem. <EOS>
<BOS> Allow me to start with the most important demand. <EOS>
<BOS> We do not want financial control to be abolished. <EOS>
<BOS> I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the best support we can give to European democracy. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr van Hulten  I think you deserve a medal for your efforts. <EOS>
<BOS> Firstly  there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> This must be regulated during the IGC. <EOS>
<BOS> This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution. <EOS>
<BOS> It now appears that this desire is more serious. <EOS>
<BOS> This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme. <EOS>
<BOS> Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise. <EOS>
<BOS> Naturally  this is only to be welcomed. <EOS>
<BOS> And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here. <EOS>
<BOS> A single key is to suffice in future. <EOS>
<BOS> However  the financial controllers must work independently. <EOS>
<BOS> Therefore  independence is prerequisite for effective checks. <EOS>
<BOS> I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote. <EOS>
<BOS> There are too many rights  too many regulations and too little room for leadership. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no backbone  and no teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> Where is the beef? <EOS>
<BOS> Romano Prodi promised a revolution. <EOS>
<BOS> Sort out the tangle of staff allowances. <EOS>
<BOS> Ensure too  that training becomes a management tool. <EOS>
<BOS> So I refer to the things I do not agree with. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament. <EOS>
<BOS> This report is about the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament is a separate subject. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> In addition to that  there is the question of duty-free. <EOS>
<BOS> It is not worthy of being brought into this report either. <EOS>
<BOS> Most of the report is about financial control. <EOS>
<BOS> That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee. <EOS>
<BOS> After all  it is only 1% of GDP  by comparison with national spending. <EOS>
<BOS> We should get it into perspective. <EOS>
<BOS> It is important to remember that. <EOS>
<BOS> The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money. <EOS>
<BOS> They have very little of it. <EOS>
<BOS> They have a much wider responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> If there is  we have generated it in this House in the past year. <EOS>
<BOS> That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well. <EOS>
<BOS> But we need radical reform. <EOS>
<BOS> There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy. <EOS>
<BOS> People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable. <EOS>
<BOS> The Financial Regulation should be amended. <EOS>
<BOS> We agree that we should have better control of the finances. <EOS>
<BOS> It is just a question of how. <EOS>
<BOS> We should be careful about this. <EOS>
<BOS> We should retain some form of ex ante financial control. <EOS>
<BOS> This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through. <EOS>
<BOS> Instead  we should be reforming and decentralising control. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission does not have enough staff. <EOS>
<BOS> The staffing system is too rigid. <EOS>
<BOS> It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees. <EOS>
<BOS> I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps this is a little worrying. <EOS>
<BOS> As Mr Blak said  we must instead establish a system with clear roles. <EOS>
<BOS> First of all  we need tough regulations  which can be implemented. <EOS>
<BOS> Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough. <EOS>
<BOS> These are what are missing. <EOS>
<BOS> Secondly  we must also clarify our own auditing roles. <EOS>
<BOS> It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation. <EOS>
<BOS> We do not hunt down criminals. <EOS>
<BOS> That is OLAF' s job. <EOS>
<BOS> Tell me what national parliament  for example  is handed all preliminary investigation documents. <EOS>
<BOS> Otherwise  we shall not get anywhere in this fight. <EOS>
<BOS> Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this. <EOS>
<BOS> A very important proposal indeed. <EOS>
<BOS> I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale. <EOS>
<BOS> In my opinion  such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally  the issue of officials. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually  I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view. <EOS>
<BOS> For example  we are currently looking into TAOs. <EOS>
<BOS> This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge. <EOS>
<BOS> This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet  and you are not responsible for this. <EOS>
<BOS> It is the responsibility of this Parliament. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile  we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence. <EOS>
<BOS> 'Long-winded' . <EOS>
<BOS> I am not going to mention the length of this report. <EOS>
<BOS> It is also 'confusing' . <EOS>
<BOS> The concept of transparency stands out in the report. <EOS>
<BOS> Securing this is a major priority. <EOS>
<BOS> The importance of smooth-running  comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough. <EOS>
<BOS> We must win back their faith in EU politics. <EOS>
<BOS> This is what enables them to understand what is going on. <EOS>
<BOS> So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House. <EOS>
<BOS> I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative. <EOS>
<BOS> I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that. <EOS>
<BOS> I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode. <EOS>
<BOS> Hence the transmission. <EOS>
<BOS> Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations. <EOS>
<BOS> That most certainly is the intention of the Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform. <EOS>
<BOS> Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital. <EOS>
<BOS> Change in the law is fundamental. <EOS>
<BOS> That service will open on 1 May this year. <EOS>
<BOS> As Budgets Commissioner  here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors. <EOS>
<BOS> This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits. <EOS>
<BOS> That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa. <EOS>
<BOS> It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control. <EOS>
<BOS> "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this. <EOS>
<BOS> The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed. <EOS>
<BOS> We are seeking to implement best practice. <EOS>
<BOS> A communication later this year will give full details. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose. <EOS>
<BOS> A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change. <EOS>
<BOS> Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House. <EOS>
<BOS> That is in line with the draft resolution. <EOS>
<BOS> I welcome Parliament's support for that. <EOS>
<BOS> The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament. <EOS>
<BOS> The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors. <EOS>
<BOS> We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform. <EOS>
<BOS> It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities. <EOS>
<BOS> A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months. <EOS>
<BOS> Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House. <EOS>
<BOS> The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome. <EOS>
<BOS> That is most certainly relevant. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament has frequently made that point. <EOS>
<BOS> Thirdly  it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken. <EOS>
<BOS> They are already having implications for resource availability. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> Such is life. <EOS>
<BOS> So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion. <EOS>
<BOS> At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track. <EOS>
<BOS> The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict. <EOS>
<BOS> Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum. <EOS>
<BOS> We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development. <EOS>
<BOS> Nor is our role confined to that of banker. <EOS>
<BOS> We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians. <EOS>
<BOS> We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan  Lebanon  Syria and Egypt. <EOS>
<BOS> European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period. <EOS>
<BOS> President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week. <EOS>
<BOS> The Commission is actively involved in those efforts. <EOS>
<BOS> We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to underline that point. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope I can add that we will want to provide that. <EOS>
<BOS> We have made progress in recent months and weeks  as Mr Gama mentioned earlier. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope the House will understand that. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  Commissioner Patten has our understanding. <EOS>
<BOS> In this sense  I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account. <EOS>
<BOS> We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process. <EOS>
<BOS> Es ist natürlich ein Friedensprozeß, der schließlich im Gange ist. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to emphasise four points. <EOS>
<BOS> This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements. <EOS>
<BOS> The second point relates to Syria. <EOS>
<BOS> There  the border question is obviously central. <EOS>
<BOS> How negotiations are proceeding there  we still do not know. <EOS>
<BOS> What is important  however  is that they have begun. <EOS>
<BOS> An important question in this context is the future distribution of water. <EOS>
<BOS> My last point concerns the future Palestinian State. <EOS>
<BOS> This is something to which we all want to contribute. <EOS>
<BOS> Indeed  both parties will need to make huge efforts. <EOS>
<BOS> It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue. <EOS>
<BOS> The moment of truth is approaching. <EOS>
<BOS> Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation? <EOS>
<BOS> Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan? <EOS>
<BOS> Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law? <EOS>
<BOS> Peace in the Middle East concerns us all  however. <EOS>
<BOS> But today  Egypt  Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel. <EOS>
<BOS> It is high time there was peace in the Middle East. <EOS>
<BOS> However  Israel is not the only country concerned with security. <EOS>
<BOS> We cannot be content with a role backstage. <EOS>
<BOS> Indeed  the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability. <EOS>
<BOS> Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press. <EOS>
<BOS> Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister. <EOS>
<BOS> His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting. <EOS>
<BOS> Well  the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question. <EOS>
<BOS> What can the European Union do in these circumstances? <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately  very little. <EOS>
<BOS> But we have enough agreements now: Oslo  Wye Plantation  Sharm el-Sheikh. <EOS>
<BOS> We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented. <EOS>
<BOS> My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel. <EOS>
<BOS> I consider this to be very encouraging news. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be a similar situation. <EOS>
<BOS> My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union. <EOS>
<BOS> This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. <EOS>
<BOS> We really hope and believe so. <EOS>
<BOS> Never have the parties been so determined. <EOS>
<BOS> There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations. <EOS>
<BOS> The same is true with regard to immigration policy. <EOS>
<BOS> Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit  thus preparing for the future. <EOS>
<BOS> We will do this today. <EOS>
<BOS> The financial envelope envisaged for 2000 is EUR 3 million. <EOS>
<BOS> Of 62 projects in all  seven included applicant countries. <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs Terrón i Cusí also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement. <EOS>
<BOS> Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime. <EOS>
<BOS> Lastly then  Europol  which started its work in 1999. <EOS>
<BOS> This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately  however  it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions. <EOS>
<BOS> Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda. <EOS>
<BOS> We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work. <EOS>
<BOS> Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I have nothing further to say to the Council. <EOS>
<BOS> The previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all! <EOS>
<BOS> I find this question more and more worrying. <EOS>
<BOS> Allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view. <EOS>
<BOS> Then there is the European Parliament  which is also complicated. <EOS>
<BOS> In other words  the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it. <EOS>
<BOS> However  I should like to make an appeal to the Council apparatchiks. <EOS>
<BOS> Scoreboard sounds like skateboard in German. <EOS>
<BOS> I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress. <EOS>
<BOS> The first is asylum. <EOS>
<BOS> Decisions on asylum should take months - not years. <EOS>
<BOS> The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems. <EOS>
<BOS> Arrested and released in Madrid  he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that it works out. <EOS>
<BOS> Numerous questions are still outstanding. <EOS>
<BOS> Answers are still awaited. <EOS>
<BOS> Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding. <EOS>
<BOS> The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force. <EOS>
<BOS> In Tampere  the question of granting operational powers was discussed. <EOS>
<BOS> The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC. <EOS>
<BOS> Parliament has amended the contractual text. <EOS>
<BOS> Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately  no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them. <EOS>
<BOS> And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres. <EOS>
<BOS> We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees. <EOS>
<BOS> The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect. <EOS>
<BOS> They were treated like the worst criminals. <EOS>
<BOS> The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour. <EOS>
<BOS> Our role should be to accompany  reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships. <EOS>
<BOS> The laws against racism must be harmonised. <EOS>
<BOS> What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty? <EOS>
<BOS> How do you aim to eradicate homophobia  racism and sexism? <EOS>
<BOS> We must take the best from each of our countries. <EOS>
<BOS> Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses. <EOS>
<BOS> The level of racism in our society is terrifying. <EOS>
<BOS> Racism in Ireland is endemic. <EOS>
<BOS> And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom  Security and Justice. <EOS>
<BOS> And who is not in favour of security  freedom and justice? <EOS>
<BOS> The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen. <EOS>
<BOS> That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems. <EOS>
<BOS> Any democrat can spot two key problems. <EOS>
<BOS> First of all  the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic. <EOS>
<BOS> It also  of course  finds indirect expression in the question. <EOS>
<BOS> Now  it is the soul. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed. <EOS>
<BOS> In 1998  we had 55 murders. <EOS>
<BOS> Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193  while those against republicans totalled 97. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  that situation cannot continue and needs remedying. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union. <EOS>
<BOS> The Euro  employment  even security  are not enough. <EOS>
<BOS> They need a 'European soul'   as a distinguished Spanish professor once said. <EOS>
<BOS> This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said. <EOS>
<BOS> As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated. <EOS>
<BOS> Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months. <EOS>
<BOS> That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about. <EOS>
<BOS> Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is. <EOS>
<BOS> I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to make three brief points. <EOS>
<BOS> Let us stop the shadow-boxing. <EOS>
<BOS> Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process. <EOS>
<BOS> My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission. <EOS>
<BOS> We have established a new Directorate-General  yet it has only 70 people all told. <EOS>
<BOS> The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs. <EOS>
<BOS> All good things come in threes  especially in our policy area. <EOS>
<BOS> The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete. <EOS>
<BOS> The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this. <EOS>
<BOS> We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements. <EOS>
<BOS> Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back]. <EOS>
<BOS> I thank them for their statements to the House. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty. <EOS>
<BOS> I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December. <EOS>
<BOS> I refer to Eurodac. <EOS>
<BOS> We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality. <EOS>
<BOS> Even in Tampere  we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality. <EOS>
<BOS> to put those decisions into practice. <EOS>
<BOS> Neither will it stop raising vital issues. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration? <EOS>
<BOS> I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency. <EOS>
<BOS> But I want to add a word of caution. <EOS>
<BOS> There are also courts in Karlsruhe  London  Lisbon  Dublin and Edinburgh. <EOS>
<BOS> We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense. <EOS>
<BOS> But we must look always to subsidiarity. <EOS>
<BOS> Like everybody in this House  I want freedom  justice and security. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation  chaos and confusion. <EOS>
<BOS> Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency. <EOS>
<BOS> (Sustained applause)
Thank you  Minister. <EOS>
<BOS> The debate is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> Their efficiency has been truly remarkable. <EOS>
<BOS> I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control. <EOS>
<BOS> Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). <EOS>
<BOS> We will examine questions to the Council. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you for your answer. <EOS>
<BOS> However  I would just like to add the following. <EOS>
<BOS> Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit. <EOS>
<BOS> My second point concerns the safety of these plants. <EOS>
<BOS> That is our role and this is the point of my question. <EOS>
<BOS> I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward. <EOS>
<BOS> This is  of course  a highly sensitive issue. <EOS>
<BOS> It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you  Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council. <EOS>
<BOS> Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information? <EOS>
<BOS> I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question. <EOS>
<BOS> I should like to have an answer to that question. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Sjöstedt  the answer that I gave was the only answer possible. <EOS>
<BOS> The matter is still open. <EOS>
<BOS> For our part  we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area. <EOS>
<BOS> It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked. <EOS>
<BOS> We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Dimitrakopoulos  transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions. <EOS>
<BOS> We will then see  at ministerial level  how we can follow this up. <EOS>
<BOS> As far as we are concerned  they will be. <EOS>
<BOS> We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand that Portugal is affected by this. <EOS>
<BOS> What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing? <EOS>
<BOS> It will not be tolerated  and must stop immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council. <EOS>
<BOS> The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations. <EOS>
<BOS> We have endeavoured to provide material help. <EOS>
<BOS> We have tried to defend peace by taking military action. <EOS>
<BOS> Honorable Member! <EOS>
<BOS> As I said I understand your concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> In other words  he has been given these resources. <EOS>
<BOS> There are two fundamental questions in particular. <EOS>
<BOS> We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Seixas da Costa  I totally agree with you. <EOS>
<BOS> Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo? <EOS>
<BOS> Since the author is not present  Question No 7 lapses. <EOS>
<BOS> However  housing is specifically excluded. <EOS>
<BOS> It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme. <EOS>
<BOS> I thank the President-in-Office for his reply. <EOS>
<BOS> The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber. <EOS>
<BOS> However  you also said something which I find particularly frightening. <EOS>
<BOS> You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development. <EOS>
<BOS> We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency. <EOS>
<BOS> But there are some questions still outstanding. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no contradiction between our two positions  quite the opposite. <EOS>
<BOS> As you can understand  it would be easy to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> Does the presidency intend to do anything about this? <EOS>
<BOS> Since the author is not present  Question No 13 lapses. <EOS>
<BOS> Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs. <EOS>
<BOS> As you know  both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately. <EOS>
<BOS> It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this. <EOS>
<BOS> I appreciate that it is a provocative question. <EOS>
<BOS> I cannot think of a better way to do it. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you? <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion. <EOS>
<BOS> I would ask him to be brief. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr President  I understand that I have to do this very quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas. <EOS>
<BOS> In Spain they say a letter to the three kings. <EOS>
<BOS> That concludes questions to the Council. <EOS>
<BOS> This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU. <EOS>
<BOS> Madam President  I do not have a great deal to add on this subject. <EOS>
<BOS> This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides. <EOS>
<BOS> We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation. <EOS>
<BOS> I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons. <EOS>
